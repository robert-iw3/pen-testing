# General

To practice Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) techniques from the CETP course, I set out to develop a toolkit leveraging a kernel-level read/write primitive to bypass security mechanisms such as LSASS’s RunasPPL protection and to enumerate and remove EDR telemetry via kernel callback manipulation. For the vulnerable driver, I used the well-known [RTCore64.sys](https://www.loldrivers.io/drivers/e32bc3da-4db1-4858-a62c-6fbe4db6afbd/) from MSI Afterburner.

# Proof of Concept code examples

This `C` project includes multiple proof-of-concept (POC) code examples that perform the following exploitation concepts:
- Changing Process Protection Levels
	- Disable Runasppl LSASS protection
- Removing Kernel Callbacks
- Disabling ETW providers
- Change process token
	- Privilege escalation to system
	- Downgrade EDR's token
- Disable DSE in case VBS is disabled and load unsigned driver

Requirements:
- All  these attacks require local administrative privileges to load the vulnerable driver.

## Kernel Callback Remover
- What does it do
	- Calculates and prints offsets by downloading symbols from the internet as in EDRSandBlast project for all kernel callbacks and their structures.
	- Writes vulnerable RTCore64 driver to `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\RTCore64.sys` and loads the driver.
	- Enumerate all loaded kernel drivers on the system
	- Enumerates all kernel callbacks and if `-d` selected also removes or unlinks them using the read and write IOCTL
		- Process Creation Kernel Callbacks - Removed through overwriting the callback address with `0x0`
		- Thread Creation Kernel Callbacks - Removed through overwriting the callback address with `0x0
		- Image Loading Kernel Callbacks - Removed through overwriting the callback address with `0x0
		- Registry Operations Kernel Callbacks - Removed through pointing the flink and blink to dwListHead (itself)
		- Object Creation Kernel Callbacks
			- Process - Removed through pointing the flink and blink to dwListHead (itself)
			- Thread - Removed through pointing the flink and blink to dwListHead (itself)
		- Minifilter Kernel Callbacks and their callbacknodes - Removed through unlinking the callbacknodes
	- Compare callback addresses with the loaded kernel drivers to check to which driver the callback belongs
	- Unloads the RTCore64 driver and removes the file from `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\RTCore64.sys`
- Filenames can be configured in `config.h`

```powershell
PS C:\ > .\KernelCallbackRemover.exe
Usage: KernelCallbackRemover.exe -l / -d
Options:
  -l List Kernel Callbacks       - Lists all kernel callbacks through vulnerable driver
  -d Disable Kernel Callbacks    - Lists and remove all kernel callbacks through vulnerable driver
  -h Display this help message.
```

#### Example removing kernel callbacks
```powershell
PS C:\ > .\KernelCallbackRemover.exe -d
```

## Protection Changer
- What does it do
	- Calculates and prints offsets by enumerating windows version with `RtlGetVersion`, offsets are hardcoded.

	- Writes vulnerable RTCore64 driver to `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\RTCore64.sys` and loads the driver
	- Gets base address of `Ntoskrnl.exe` and calculates `PsInitialSystemProcess` offset
	- Changes the protection using the read and write IOCTL, writing the chosen protection value to the `_PS_PROTECTION Protection` struct in the `E_PROCESS`
	- Unloads the RTCore64 driver and removes the file from `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\RTCore64.sys`
- Filenames and service names can be configured in `config.h`

```powershell
PS C:\ > .\ProtectionChanger.exe
Usage: ProtectionChanger.exe -p <PID> -v <NEW PROTECTION LEVEL>
Options:
  -p <pid>              Specify the process ID (PID) of the process to change the protection level.
  -v <protection_level> Specify the protection level value in hexadecimal (e.g., 0x00 for NO_PROTECTION).
  -h                    Display this help message.

Possible protection level values:
  0x72  PS_PROTECTED_SYSTEM               System protected process
  0x62  PS_PROTECTED_WINTCB               Windows TCB protected process
  0x52  PS_PROTECTED_WINDOWS              Windows protected process
  0x12  PS_PROTECTED_AUTHENTICODE         Authenticode protected process
  0x61  PS_PROTECTED_WINTCB_LIGHT         Windows TCB light protected process
  0x51  PS_PROTECTED_WINDOWS_LIGHT        Windows light protected process
  0x41  PS_PROTECTED_LSA_LIGHT            LSA light protected process
  0x31  PS_PROTECTED_ANTIMALWARE_LIGHT    Antimalware light protected process
  0x11  PS_PROTECTED_AUTHENTICODE_LIGHT   Authenticode light protected process
  0x00  NO_PROTECTION for no protection
```

#### Example lsass
- Example removing runasppl from LSASS process by setting the protection value to `0x00`

```powershell
PS C:\ > .\ProtectionChanger.exe -v 0x00 -p (Get-Process -Name lsass).id
```

## ETwTi Remover
- What does it do
	- Calculates and prints offsets by downloading symbols from the internet as in EDRSandBlast project
	- Writes vulnerable RTCore64 driver to `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\RTCore64.sys` and loads the driver
	- Disables or enables ETwTi using the read and write IOCTL writing to the `ProviderEnableInfo` field
	- Unloads the RTCore64 driver and removes the file from `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\RTCore64.sys`
- Filenames can be configured in `config.h`

```powershell
PS C:\ > .\ETwTiRemover.exe
Usage: ETwTiRemover.exe -e / -d
Options:
  -e Enable ETwTi     - set ProviderEnableInfo field within the GUID entry to 0x1

	- Enables DSE again using the read and write IOCTL, writing `0x6` (DSE Enabled mode) to `g_CiOptions`
	- Unloads the RTCore64 driver and removes the file from `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\RTCore64.sys`
- Requirements;
	- Virtualized Based Security (VBS) to be disabled
- Filenames and service names can be configured in `config.h`

```powershell
PS C:\ > .\DSERemover.exe
```

# Cleanup
- The PE file should unload and remove the RTCORE driver. If it didn't then manually remove it or run the `cleanup.bat` script.
- Also removes the ROOTKIT service and driver from the DSERemover project incase its there

```cmd
sc stop RTCORE
sc delete RTCORE
sc stop ROOTKIT
sc delete ROOTKIT

del C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\RTCore64.sys
del C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\FirstDriver.sys
```
