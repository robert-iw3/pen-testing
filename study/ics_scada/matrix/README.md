## Architecture

The M.A.T.R.I.X tool is designed with a modular architecture that separates the command-line interface from the individual attack modules. This section provides insights into the tool's structure through class diagrams, package organization, and attack workflow visualization.

### Class Diagram

![Class Diagram](assets/matrix_class_diagram.png)

The class diagram illustrates the object-oriented architecture of M.A.T.R.I.X:

- **MatrixCLI**: The central command-line interface class that processes user arguments and orchestrates the execution of attack modules.
  - Contains methods for parsing arguments, displaying help information, and initializing attack modules.
  - Manages the execution flow and reporting of results.

- **Attack Modules**: Each specialized attack functionality is encapsulated in its own class:
  - **ModbusUnauthorizedReader**: Implements functions for scanning and reading values from Modbus registers and coils without authorization.
  - **ModbusUnauthorizedCoilWriter**: Contains methods for unauthorized manipulation of coil states.
  - **ModbusUnauthorizedHoldingRegisterWriter**: Handles unauthorized writing to holding registers.
  - **ModbusOverflowAttacker**: Implements methods to test for integer overflow vulnerabilities in Modbus implementations.
  - **ModbusReplayAttacker**: Provides functionality to capture, analyze, and replay Modbus traffic for attack simulation.
  - **ModbusResponseSpoofer**: Implements methods to craft and send falsified Modbus responses.
  - **ModbusDosAttacker**: Contains methods for executing denial-of-service attacks through connection flooding.

Each attack module inherits common attributes like host IP, port, and ModbusTcpClient instances, while implementing unique attack functionality through specialized methods.

### Package Structure

![Package Structure](assets/matrix_package_diagram.png)

The package organization of M.A.T.R.I.X follows a logical structure:

- **The M.A.T.R.I.X Project** (Yellow container): The overall project boundary.
  - **matrix.py**: The main CLI interface file that serves as the entry point for the tool.
  - **README.md**: Documentation for the project.
  - **requirements.txt**: Lists the project dependencies.

- **The 'attacks' Folder** (Orange container): Contains all attack module implementations.
  - **__init__.py**: Package initialization file that enables importing from the attacks package.
  - **Individual attack modules**: Seven Python files implementing specific attack functionalities.

- **External Dependencies** (Blue container): Shows the third-party libraries required by the project.
  - **pymodbus**: Primary library for Modbus protocol implementation.
  - **scapy**: Used for packet manipulation in spoofing and replay attacks.
  - **tabulate**: Provides formatted table output for better readability of results.

The arrows between components represent import relationships, showing how the modules connect and depend on each other.

### Attack Workflows

![Attack Workflows](assets/matrix_workflow_diagram.png)

The workflow diagram outlines the execution process for each attack type:

- **Unauthorized Read Attack**: 
  - Connects to the target Modbus server
  - Sequentially reads values from coils, discrete inputs, holding registers, and input registers
  - Reports the discovered information

- **Unauthorized Coils/Registers Write Attack**:
  - Establishes a connection to the target
  - Writes unauthorized values to coils or registers
  - Reads back the changed values to verify the attack was successful
  - Confirms changes were applied to the target system

- **DoS Attack**:
  - Initializes multiple threads for concurrent connections
  - Creates numerous connections to the target
  - Floods the server with Modbus requests
  - Continuously monitors target response to determine impact

- **Replay Attack**:
  - Loads captured Modbus traffic from a PCAP file
  - Extracts and analyzes Modbus packet structures
  - Replays captured request packets to the target
  - Compares original and new responses to identify discrepancies

- **Spoof Attack**:
  - Crafts custom Modbus responses with falsified data
  - Sets the source address to match a legitimate Modbus server
  - Sends the spoofed packets to the target
  - Observes system behavior to assess impact

All attack workflows conclude with a comprehensive results report.

### Implementation Notes

The modular design allows for:
- Easy extension with new attack modules
- Independent testing and development of individual attack types
- Consistent interface across different attack functionalities
- Simplified maintenance and updates

## Design Pattern

M.A.T.R.I.X follows the [Command pattern](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/9781492077992/ch06.html), where each attack module encapsulates a specific action with a consistent execution interface. This design allows the main program to invoke different attacks without knowing their specific implementation details.

Key aspects of the Command pattern implementation:
- Each attack module represents a command with methods like `run_test()`, `launch_attack()`, or `run_comprehensive_scan()`
- The main program (`matrix.py`) acts as the invoker that selects and executes the appropriate command
- All commands share similar initialization parameters (host, port) for consistent interface
- Each command encapsulates all the logic needed for its specific attack type

This design makes it easy to add new attack types without modifying existing code, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.

## Dependencies

M.A.T.R.I.X relies on the following key dependencies:

- **pymodbus**: Core library for Modbus TCP protocol communication, used for reading and writing to Modbus registers and coils
- **scapy**: Powerful packet manipulation library used for crafting custom packets in spoof attacks and analyzing PCAP files in replay attacks
- **tabulate**: Used to create formatted tables for displaying attack results in a readable format

Additional system requirements:
- **libpcap-dev**: Required for the packet capture functionality used in replay and spoof attacks
- **Root privileges**: Required for sending raw packets in spoofing attacks and capturing packets in replay attacks

## Advanced Usage

### Standalone Mode

Some attack modules can be run in standalone mode with elevated privileges:

```
sudo python matrix.py -H 192.168.1.10 -p 502 -a replay --standalone -f traffic.pcap
```

```
sudo python matrix.py -H 192.168.1.10 -p 502 -a spoof --standalone -s 192.168.1.20 -i eth0
```

Standalone mode is particularly useful for attacks that require root privileges or direct system access.
