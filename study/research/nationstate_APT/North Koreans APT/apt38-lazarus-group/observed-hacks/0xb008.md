# 0xB008Ce23852Be9e7d43638432617617b2e07B41e

A few months back when the Ronin dude got hacked we noticed that the theft address dumped into Tornado Cash and then sent all remaining dust into this weird address 0xb008ce23852be9e7d43638432617617b2e07b41e.

This is an address owned by this weird character butterfly who's associated with Tornado Cash somehow. I cant keep up with the drama but that address was (is as of June 2024) on the Tornado Cash frontend as a donate address.

It also now has ENS name `tornado-donations.eth`

What does get interesting is there were actually a few addresses that did the same private key compromise -> dump into tornado -> send dust to boob.
