# Cobalt Kitty & APT39: TTP Defense Matrix

### Overview

This project delivers an in depth analysis of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) using the MITRE ATT&CK Framework and NIST 800 standards. By unraveling the tactics, sophisticated techniques, and persistent strategies employed in Operation Cobalt Kitty and APT39, this research uncovers critical insights into adversary behavior, attack patterns, and cyber defense strategies.
 It focuses on dissecting and comparing two major cyber threat campaigns:

- Operation Cobalt Kitty

- APT39 <br><br>

## Understanding the MITRE ATT&CK Framework

- The MITRE ATT&CK Framework is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversarial tactics and techniques used by cyber threat actors. It provides insights into real-world attack behaviors categorized under:

- Tactics: High-level attack goals such as Initial Access, Persistence, and Command & Control.

- Techniques & Sub-Techniques: Specific methods used to achieve tactics, like Phishing, Credential Dumping, or Lateral Movement.

- Procedures: Detailed attack implementations observed in real-world incidents.

- This framework allows cyber threat analysts, SOC teams, and incident responders to map, analyze, and understand attack patterns for enhanced defense strategies.
## Understanding the NIST 800 Framework
- The NIST 800 Series provides guidelines for cybersecurity risk management, controls, and compliance. It ensures that security measures align with best practices for government and private sector organizations. Key aspects include:

- Risk Assessment & Management (NIST 800-30): Identifying and mitigating cybersecurity risks.

- Incident Response Planning (NIST 800-61): Structured approach to handling and mitigating security breaches.

- Security Control Implementation (NIST 800-53): Defining security requirements to protect against cyber threats.

- Continuous Monitoring & Improvement (NIST 800-137): Ensuring ongoing security effectiveness through regular assessments.

- By integrating NIST 800 principles into this analysis, the project provides a structured approach to evaluating and mitigating APT-related threats.
## Project Methodology
### 1. Data Collection & Initial Analysis

- Gathered and reviewed official threat intelligence reports on Operation Cobalt Kitty and APT39.

- Extracted critical details related to malware behavior, attack vectors, and techniques used.

### 2. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping & Analysis

- Individually mapped each APT campaign to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, identifying tactics, techniques, and sub-techniques relevant to the malware and operational methods used.

- Used ATT&CK Navigator to visualize and structure this mapping.

### 3. ATT&CK Navigator & Risk Categorization

- What is ATT&CK Navigator?

    A web-based tool that enables analysts to visualize, layer, and analyze ATT&CK mappings effectively.Helps in identifying trends, overlaps, and relationships between different threat groups.

    #### Severity-based Risk Categorization:

    - Implemented a color-coded severity scale (0-4):

            0 (Blue) → Low risk

            1 (Light Purple) → Moderate risk

            2 (Purple) → Elevated risk

            3 (Light Red) → High risk

            4 (Red) → Critical risk

- Each identified technique was categorized based on its impact and risk level.

### 4. Comparative ATT&CK Matrix Analysis

- Conducted a comparative analysis by overlapping the MITRE ATT&CK matrices for both APT groups.

- Identified common TTPs used across Operation Cobalt Kitty and APT39.

- Mapped behavioral similarities between the two threat actor groups.

### 5. NIST 800-Based Risk Assessment & Compliance Mapping

-  Risk Identification & Categorization:

    - Applied NIST 800-30 principles to assess risks associated with the identified TTPs.
    - Mapped threats to NIST 800-53 security controls to identify gaps in security postures.

- Incident Response Framework:

    - Used NIST 800-61 guidelines to outline structured incident response measures.
    - Created detection & mitigation strategies based on attack vectors identified in the ATT&CK analysis.

- Continuous Monitoring & Improvement:

    - Leveraged NIST 800-137 to recommend real-time security monitoring practices.
    - Suggested enhanced threat intelligence sharing and automated defenses.

#### 6. Defense & Security Posture Recommendations

- Based on the comparative findings, outlined defensive measures for organizations to mitigate the threats posed by these APTs.

- Recommended proactive threat detection, security controls, and mitigation strategies to reduce attack surface exposure.
