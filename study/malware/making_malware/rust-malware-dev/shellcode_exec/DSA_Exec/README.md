## DSA SHellcode Execution Methods

This is my small series about using data structures and algorithms on malware development series.
Feel feel to DM me if you have implemented any Execution methods using DSA Concepts.

### Why DSA ?

Using DSA Will give malware an great advantage to evade detection and optimize the execution speed and efficiency of shellcode, making attacks quicker and less resource-intensive.
