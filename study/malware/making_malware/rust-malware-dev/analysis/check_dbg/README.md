# Check_Dbg

A Rust-based tool for detecting running malware analysis and debugging tools on Windows systems.

## Description

Check_Dbg is a utility that scans for commonly used malware analysis, debugging, and system monitoring tools. It helps identify if any of these tools are currently running on the system, which can be useful for security testing and anti-debugging purposes.

## Features

- Scans for over 30 different malware analysis and debugging tools
- Uses Windows API to enumerate running processes
- Provides clear output indicating which tools are detected
- Written in Rust for performance and safety

## List of Detected Tools

The tool checks for the following applications:
- Debuggers: OllyDbg, x32dbg, x64dbg, WinDbg, Immunity Debugger
- Process Analysis: Process Hacker, Process Explorer, ProcMon
- Network Analysis: Wireshark, Fiddler, TCPView
- System Monitoring: FileMon, RegMon, Autoruns
- Reverse Engineering: IDA Pro, ImportREC, PETools, LordPE
- Other Tools: Cheat Engine, Frida, Resource Hacker

## Requirements

- Rust toolchain
- Windows operating system
- WinAPI dependencies

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

Simply run the compiled executable:

```bash
./target/release/check_dbg
```

The program will scan for running processes and output which malware analysis tools are detected.
