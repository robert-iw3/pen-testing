## EARLYCASCADE INJECTION IN RUST

This is just a simple PoC implementation of the early cascade injection technique documented by the Outflank blog post.

Special Thanks to [@C5pider](https://x.com/C5pider) for his POC for Early-Cascade Injection.

This code was tested on Microsoft Windows 11 Home [Version	10.0.22631]

## PoC
