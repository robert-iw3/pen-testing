## Self Deletion Using Alternate Data Stream

The code creates an alternate data stream, which isn't visible in typical file listings, and uses this to manipulate the file in a way that allows for self-deletion.

By renaming the file's alternate data stream, it essentially prepares the file for an operation that can be performed on itself without directly needing admin permissions for file deletion.

The actual deletion occurs when the file handle is closed after marking the file for deletion, which is a Windows feature where marking a file for deletion and then closing the last handle to it results in the file being deleted.

## Usage

```
cargo build --release

./target/release/Alternate_Data_Stream.exe
```
