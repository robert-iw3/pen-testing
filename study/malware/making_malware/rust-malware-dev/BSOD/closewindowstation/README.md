- Demonstrates handle protection techniques
- Hides console window during execution

## Dependencies
- winapi

## Usage
1. Compile the program using Cargo
2. Run the executable
3. BSOD will be triggered through window station manipulation

## Technical Details
The program uses several Windows API functions:
- CreateWindowStationA
- SetHandleInformation
- GetConsoleWindow
- ShowWindow
