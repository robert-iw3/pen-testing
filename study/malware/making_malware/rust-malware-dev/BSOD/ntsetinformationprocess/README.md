## Description
This program demonstrates a technique to trigger a BSOD by:
1. Obtaining process token with necessary privileges
2. Enabling debug privileges
3. Setting the current process as critical using NtSetInformationProcess
4. Closing the program triggers the BSOD

## Features
- Uses Windows API functions for process manipulation
- Demonstrates proper error handling
- Sets process as critical for system stability

## Dependencies
- winapi
- ntapi

## Usage
1. Compile the program using Cargo
2. Run the executable
3. The program will set itself as critical
4. Closing the program will trigger a BSOD

## Technical Details
The program uses several Windows API functions:
- OpenProcessToken
- LookupPrivilegeValueA
- AdjustTokenPrivileges
- NtSetInformationProcess

## Warning
This program is for educational purposes only. Running it will cause a system crash and data loss. Use with caution and only in controlled environments.
