# Local Mapping Injection

A Rust implementation of local mapping injection technique, demonstrating advanced memory manipulation and process injection methods. This project showcases the use of Windows API for file mapping and memory operations.


## Features

- File mapping creation and manipulation
- Memory mapping and protection
- Thread creation and management
- Shellcode execution
- Error handling and status reporting

## Technical Details

The project implements:
- Windows File Mapping API usage
- Memory mapping and protection
- Thread creation and synchronization
- Shellcode injection through mapping
- Handle management

### Key Components

1. **File Mapping**
   - Creates file mapping object
   - Maps view of file into process address space
   - Sets appropriate memory protection flags

2. **Memory Operations**
   - Memory mapping
   - Shellcode copying
   - Memory protection manipulation

3. **Thread Management**
   - Thread creation
   - Thread synchronization
   - Handle cleanup

## Usage

1. Build the project using Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```

## Dependencies

- winapi: Windows API bindings with specific features:
  - errhandlingapi
  - handleapi
  - memoryapi
  - processthreadsapi
  - synchapi
  - winbase
  - winnt
