## Features

- Double-buffered rendering system
- Real-time animation with configurable parameters
- Pause/Resume functionality
- Window focus handling
- GDI graphics manipulation
- CPU-intensive graphics operations

## Technical Details

The project implements a sophisticated graphics system using:
- Windows GDI (Graphics Device Interface)
- Double buffering for smooth rendering
- Custom window class and message handling
- Real-time animation timing system
- Bitmap manipulation and distortion effects

### Key Components

1. **Backbuffer System**
   - Manages primary and secondary buffers
   - Handles device context creation and management
   - Implements buffer swapping for smooth rendering

2. **Object System**
   - Manages animated objects with properties like:
     - Amplitude
     - Frequency
     - Offset
     - Position and dimensions

3. **Message Loop**
   - Implements a custom message processing system
   - Handles window events and user input
   - Manages animation timing and frame updates

## Usage

1. Build the project using Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```

3. Controls:
   - Press Pause key to toggle animation
   - Click window to force redraw
   - Close window to exit

## Dependencies

- winapi: Windows API bindings

## Warning

This demo is designed to be CPU-intensive and should be used with caution. It's recommended to run this in a controlled environment where you can monitor system resources.
