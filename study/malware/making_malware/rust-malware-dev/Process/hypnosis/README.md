# Process Hypnosis

A Rust implementation of Process Hypnosis, a technique for debugger-assisted control flow hijacking. This project demonstrates advanced Windows debugging and process manipulation techniques.

## Features

- Process debugging and control
- DLL loading monitoring
- Memory manipulation
- Symbol resolution
- Shellcode execution
- Debug event handling

## Technical Details

The project implements:
- Windows Debug API usage
- Process creation and debugging
- Memory reading and writing
- Symbol resolution and lookup
- Exception handling
- Thread management

### Key Components

1. **Debug Event Handling**
   - Process creation events
   - Thread creation events
   - DLL loading events
   - Exception events
   - Breakpoint handling

2. **Memory Operations**
   - Process memory reading
   - Process memory writing
   - Memory protection manipulation
   - Shellcode injection

3. **Symbol Resolution**
   - Symbol initialization
   - Symbol lookup
   - Address resolution
   - Function address retrieval

## Usage

1. Build the project using Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```

## Dependencies

- winapi: Windows API bindings with specific features:
  - debugapi
  - errhandlingapi
  - memoryapi
  - minwinbase
  - processthreadsapi
  - winbase
