# EnumDesktopsA Demo

A Rust implementation demonstrating the use of Windows API's EnumDesktopsA function to iterate through all desktops associated with the calling process's window station. This project showcases advanced Windows API usage and shellcode execution techniques.

## Features

- Desktop enumeration using Windows API
- Shellcode execution demonstration
- Memory allocation and manipulation
- Process window station interaction

## Technical Details

The project implements:
- Windows Desktop enumeration
- Memory allocation for shellcode
- Shellcode execution through desktop enumeration
- Process window station management

### Key Components

1. **Desktop Enumeration**
   - Uses EnumDesktopsA to list all desktops
   - Interacts with process window station
   - Executes shellcode through enumeration callback

2. **Memory Management**
   - Allocates memory for shellcode
   - Uses RtlMoveMemory for safe memory operations
   - Sets appropriate memory protection flags

## Usage

1. Build the project using Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```

## Dependencies

- winapi: Windows API bindings with specific features:
  - memoryapi
  - winnt
  - winuser
