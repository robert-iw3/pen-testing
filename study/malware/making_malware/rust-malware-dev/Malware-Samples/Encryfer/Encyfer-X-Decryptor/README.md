## Encryfer-X-Decryptor


### Overview 
The Decryptor Tool is designed to decrypt files that were previously encrypted using our Encryfer-X Tool tool. This project provides a secure and efficient way to revert the encrypted files back to their original state, ensuring that the data is fully restored and usable.

The Decryptor Tool identifies these files(.smukx) decrypts them using the same keys and algorithms, and restores them to their original form.
