## Requirements

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): Rust is a modern and secure programming language used to develop the tools in this repository.
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/): Cargo is Rust's package manager and compiler, essential for compiling and running projects.

## Compile

### Compiling the Project

To start the compilation, use the following command:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### Adding Destination Architectures

If you are using a different operating system or need to compile for a specific architecture, you can list all available target architectures with the following command:

```sh
rustup target list
```

Once you have identified the desired target architecture, add it using rustup:

```sh
rustup target add <arch>
```

Replace `<arch>` with the desired architecture, such as `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`.

### Compiling for a Specific Architecture

Then compile the project for the specific architecture:

```sh
cargo build --release --target <arch>
```
