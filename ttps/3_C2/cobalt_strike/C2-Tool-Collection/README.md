# Outflank - C2 Tool Collection

This repository contains a collection of tools which integrate with Cobalt Strike (and possibly other C2 frameworks) through BOF and reflective DLL loading techniques.

These tools are not part of our [commercial OST product](https://outflank.nl/services/outflank-security-tooling/) and are written with the goal of contributing to the community to which we owe a lot. Currently this repo contains a section with [BOF](https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/topics/beacon-object-files_main.htm) (Beacon Object Files) tools and a section with other tools (exploits, reflective DLLs, etc.).
All these tools are written by our team members and are used by us in red team assignments. Over time, more tools will be added or modified with new techniques or functionality.

## Toolset contents
The toolset currently consists of the following tools:

## How to use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Each tool contains an individual README.md file with instructions on how to compile and use the tool. With this approach, we want to give the user the choice of which tool they want to use without having to compile all the other tools.
3. If you would like to compile all the BOF tools at once, type `make` within the [BOF](BOF/) subfolder.
