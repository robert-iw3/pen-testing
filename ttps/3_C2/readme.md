## Command & Control Phase

"C2" or "Command and Control" refers to a phase in an attack cycle where attackers establish communication channels with compromised systems to issue instructions, extract data, or launch further attacks. This phase typically occurs after the initial access, allowing attackers to manage and control the compromised system(s).

Elaboration:

    Purpose:
    The primary goal of the C2 phase is to provide attackers with the ability to remotely manage and control compromised systems.

    Establishment of Communication:
    Attackers establish C2 channels using various methods, including exploiting vulnerabilities, using compromised websites, or leveraging legitimate services.

Activities during C2:

    Once established, C2 allows attackers to:

    Issue commands to install additional malware or tools.

    Exfiltrate data from the compromised system(s).

    Launch further attacks within the network.

    Spread malware to other systems.

Detection and Defense:

Cybersecurity defenses aim to identify and disrupt C2 activity to prevent attackers from completing their objectives.

Example:

Attackers might use a C2 server to remotely control a compromised computer, directing it to download additional malware or steal data from the network.
