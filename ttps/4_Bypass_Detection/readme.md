## Bypass Detection

"Bypassing the detection phase" is a term often used in cybersecurity, particularly in the context of attacks and penetration testing, to refer to techniques used to evade detection by security measures like firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

Attackers can employ various techniques to bypass detection measures. These include:

    Evading Firewalls: This can be achieved through methods like encapsulating traffic (e.g., SSH, HTTP/HTTPS, or DNS tunneling), manipulating source ports, fragmenting packets, or using Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) scripts to modify packet structures or spoof IP addresses.

    Evading Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): Techniques include using VPNs or proxy servers, slow-and-low scanning, using legitimate system tools in "Living off the Land" attacks, code obfuscation, fileless attacks, employing rootkits or bootkits, and timing attacks.

    Bypassing Network Resource Monitors: VPNs, proxy servers, encryption, malware, or social engineering can be used to conceal network activity or gain unauthorized access.

    Other Techniques: These encompass using zero-day exploits, steganography (hiding data within files), social engineering, gaining physical access, credential stuffing, using malicious USB drives, insider threats, and supply chain attacks.

It is important to note that bypassing security controls is illegal and unethical in unauthorized contexts. These techniques should only be studied and applied in ethical hacking and penetration testing with explicit permission. Organizations should implement strong security measures to detect and prevent such activities.
