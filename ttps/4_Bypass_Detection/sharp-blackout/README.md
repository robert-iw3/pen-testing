# SharpBlackout
 Terminate AV/EDR leveraging BYOVD attack 


> Note: This project is for educational purposes only.

Sharpblackout is an adaptation of the [@Blackout](https://github.com/ZeroMemoryEx/Blackout) project originally developed in C++ by [@ZeroMemoryEx](https://github.com/ZeroMemoryEx/Blackout), which consists of removing AV/EDRs using the gmer (BYOVD) driver.

Just wanted to try making it in C#

❗️ **Important:** This requires Administrator privileges for it to work.

⚠️ **Warning:** This might be buggy and not work to keep Defender or other programs terminated.
