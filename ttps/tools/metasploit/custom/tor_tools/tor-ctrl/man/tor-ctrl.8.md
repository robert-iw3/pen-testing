# NAME

tor-ctrl - Interact with Tor's controller via command line tool

# SYNOPSIS

**tor-ctrl** [**-qmVw**] [**-p** *pwd*] [**-s** *socket*] [**-t** *time*] [[**-c**|**--**] *command*]

# DESCRIPTION

**tor-ctrl** is a command line tool for setting up stream for communication from the Tor Controller's (client) to a Tor process (server). The client send commands using TCP sockets or Unix-domain sockets and receive replies from the server.
The following configuration lines must be inserted to your torrc and tor reloaded to apply the changes.

In order to get this to work, define the socket that will control the tor process, can be a TCP socket *ControlPort 9051* or a Unix-domain socket *ControlSocket /path/to/socket*.

To secure the controller, you must setup and authentication method, which can be a cookie
*CookieAuthentication 1* or if you want a fixed password, hash a password with command below and use the same output given as the configuration line (change `YOUR_PASSOWRD`, but maintain it double quoted):
```
echo "HashedControlPassword $(tor --hash-password "YOUR_PASSWORD")"
```

# OPTIONS

[**-c**|**--**] [*command*]
: command to execute. If the command option is *-c*, you must "quote" your command. If the command option is *--*, option parsing will stop, meaning that any option specified after it won't be parsed, the benefit is that it becomes unnecessary to quote your command. To use different commands together, you must make shell escape to a new line with *\\\\n*.

**-s** *socket*
: Tor's control socket. Accept *TCP socket* in the format [*addr:*]*port* (examples: 9051, 127.0.0.1:9051). Accept *Unix-domain socket* in the following format [*unix:*]*path* (examples: /run/tor/control, unix:/run/tor/control). (Default: 9051).

**-p** *pwd*
: Use password instead of tor's cookie. (Default: not used).

**-t** *time*
: Sleep N seconds after each command sent. (Default for socat/nc: 0 second, Default for telnet: 1 second).

**-w**
: After sending the command, wait for interrupt signal, normally Ctrl+C, before closing the connection. Useful when you want to be warned about events (asynchronous replies), example is when the command is *SETEVENTS STREAM*. The exit code shall not be evaluated. (Default: not set)

**-m**
: Machine mode. Script informational and warning messages won't be printed to stdout. (Default: not set).

**-q**
: Quiet mode. (Default: not set).

**-V**
: Print version information and exit.

# DEBUGGING OPTIONS

**-d**
: Debug mode. The shell shall write to standard error a trace for each command after it expands the command and before it executes it. (Default: not set).

**-r**
: Dry-run mode. Show what would be done, without sending commands to the controller. (Default: not set).

# EXIT CODES

**0**
: Success.

**>0**
: Fail.

# EXAMPLES

Check your tor software version:
```
tor-ctrl GETINFO version
```

Get your SocksPort configuration and check where tor is listening for socks connections:
```
tor-ctrl -s 9051 -p foobar -- GETCONF SocksPort \\n GETINFO net/listeners/socks
```

Set bandwidth rate:
```
tor-ctrl -q SETCONF bandwidthrate=1mb
```

For setting the bandwidth for specific times of the day, I suggest calling tor-ctrl via cron. e.g: set the bandwidth to 100kb at 07:00 and to 1mb at 22:00. You can use notations like 1mb, 1kb or the number of bytes:
```
0 22 * * * /path/to/tor-ctrl -c "SETCONF bandwidthrate=1mb"

0 7 * * *  /path/to/tor-ctrl -c "SETCONF bandwidthrate=100kb"
```
