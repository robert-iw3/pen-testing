A Python tool that leverages SharePointâ€™s `_api/search/query` endpoint to enumerate sensitive files potentially containing credentials and download them in bulk using authenticated session cookies.

**For detailed background, API internals, and mitigation strategies, please refer to the blog post:** https://blog.fndsec.net/2025/04/02/breaking-down-sharepoint-walls/

## Introduction

ShareFiltrator is a command-line tool designed to efficiently discover and optionally download files stored across SharePoint sites and OneDrive folders within a Microsoft 365 tenant. It utilizes SharePoint's search API and relies on authenticated session cookies (`rtFa` and `FedAuth`) extracted from a user's browser session.

The primary goal is to identify files exposed due to overly permissive sharing settings, which might contain sensitive information like credentials or secrets.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.x
*   Access to an authenticated Microsoft 365 / SharePoint session.
*   `rtFa` and `FedAuth` cookies from the authenticated session for the target SharePoint domain.

## Installation

1.  Build container image:
    ```bash
    podman build -t sharefiltrator .
    ```
2.  Run container:
    ```bash
    podman run -it --name sharefiltrator sharefiltrator
    ```

## Usage

You must extract the `rtFa` and `FedAuth` cookies for your target SharePoint domain (e.g., `yourcompany.sharepoint.com`) from your browser's developer tools after logging in.

```
usage: python3 sharefiltrator.py [-h] -d DOMAIN -r RTFA -f FEDAUTH -o OUTPUT_FILE [-q QUERY] [-rq REFINEMENT_FILTERS] [-s SAVE] [-t MAX_THREADS] [-m MAX_SIZE] [-p PRESET]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DOMAIN, --domain DOMAIN
                        SharePoint domain (e.g., yourcompany.sharepoint.com)
  -r RTFA, --rtfa RTFA  rtFa cookie value
  -f FEDAUTH, --fedauth FEDAUTH
                        FedAuth cookie value
  -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output_file OUTPUT_FILE
                        Output file name for URLs
  -q QUERY, --query QUERY
                        Search query to use (default - finds sites & personal OneDrive folders which are shared)
  -rq REFINEMENT_FILTERS, --refinement_filters REFINEMENT_FILTERS
                        Refinement filters to use
  -s SAVE, --save SAVE  Folder name to download files found (example: 'files')
  -t MAX_THREADS, --max_threads MAX_THREADS
                        Max threads to use for file downloads (default: 10)
  -m MAX_SIZE, --max_size MAX_SIZE
                        Max file size to download in MB (default: 20 MB, example: 100)
  -p PRESET, --preset PRESET
                        Preset file with a line seprated list of queries to run
```

**Finding Cookies:**

Open your browser's developer tools (usually F12), navigate to the "Application" (Chrome/Edge) or "Storage" (Firefox) tab, select "Cookies", find your SharePoint domain, and copy the values for `rtFa` and `FedAuth`.

## Example Usage

**Run a default query and save URLs:**

```bash
python sharefiltrator.py -d yourcompany.sharepoint.com -r <rtFa_cookie_value> -f <FedAuth_cookie_value> -o discovered_urls.txt
```

**Search for files containing "password" and download them:**

```bash
python sharefiltrator.py -d yourcompany.sharepoint.com -r <rtFa_cookie> -f <FedAuth_cookie> -o password_files.txt -q "password" -s downloaded_passwords
```

**Run the Snaffpoint preset queries, download files up to 50MB:**

```bash
python sharefiltrator.py -d yourcompany.sharepoint.com -p ./presets/snaffpoint.json -s snaffpoint_results -r <rtFa_cookie> -f <FedAuth_cookie> -o snaffpoint_urls.txt -m 50
```

**Run the Creds preset queries with 20 download threads:**

```bash
python sharefiltrator.py -d yourcompany.sharepoint.com -p ./presets/creds.json -s cred_results -r <rtFa_cookie> -f <FedAuth_cookie> -o creds_urls.txt
```

## Preset Queries

Use the `-p` flag to specify a JSON file containing multiple queries to run sequentially. Two presets are included:

*   `presets/snaffpoint.json`: Rules inspired by Snaffler/Snaffpoint.
*   `presets/creds.json`: Fine-tuned rules focusing on credentials and secrets.

Results from all queries in the preset are appended to the output file (`-o`), and matching files are downloaded to the save directory (`-s`), if specified.

## Post-Enumeration Strategy

After running ShareFiltrator, especially if many files are downloaded (`-s <folder>`):

1.  **Automated Credential Scanning:** Use tools like [Snaffler](https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler) on the download directory.
2.  **AI/Scripted Analysis:** Process file contents programmatically to extract potential secrets.
3.  **Manual Code Search:** Use VSCode or similar tools with global search (`CTRL + SHIFT + F`) in the download directory for keywords.
4.  **Review URL List:** Check the `-o` file for interesting file names (`config`, `.env`, `backup`, `credentials`, etc.).
5.  **Explore Surroundings:** If a sensitive file is found, check its parent directory in SharePoint/OneDrive for other potentially missed files.
