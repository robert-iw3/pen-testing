# CRED-4

## Description
Retrieve legacy secrets from the CIM repository

## MITRE ATT&CK TTPs
- [TA0006](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006/) - Credential Access
- [T1555](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/) - Passwords from Password Stores

## Requirements
- Local administrator privileges on an SCCM client

## Summary
The [network access account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/hierarchy/accounts#network-access-account) (NAA) is a domain account that can be configured on the site server. Clients use the NAA to access and retrieve software from a distribution point, but it serves no other purpose on the client. The credentials are retrieved by clients as part of the Computer Policy. Once received by the client, the credentials are stored in the `CCM_NetworkAccessAccount` class in the `root\ccm\policy\Machine\ActualConfig` WMI namespace.

This technique may apply whether an NAA is currently configured [CRED-3](../CRED-3/cred-3_description.md) or not. Therefore, even if [CRED-3](../CRED-3/cred-3_description.md) is fruitless, there is still hope.

Data stored within WMI classes exists on disk in the CIM repository file located at `C:\Windows\System32\wbem\Repository\OBJECTS.DATA`. Due to the [nuance](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-wmi/blob/master/python-cim/doc/data-recovery.md) of how WMI and CIM clean up these objects, they may be cleared from the database (as read from a WMI context) but still persist on disk in the CIM repository file.

The credentials exist in the file in the following format: `CCM_NetworkAccessAccount  <PolicySecret Version="1"><![CDATA[0601000001000000D08C9DDF0115D1118C7A00C04FC297EB...`. The file can be searched either manually in a text or hex editor, or this process can be automated with [SharpDPAPI's search command](https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpDPAPI?tab=readme-ov-file#search): `SharpDPAPI.exe search /type:file /path:C:\Windows\System32\wbem\Repository\OBJECTS.DATA`.

If an encrypted blob exists, it can be extracted and decrypted using the SYSTEM DPAPI masterkey and [SharpDPAPI](https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpDPAPI), or this process can be automated with [SharpSCCM](https://github.com/Mayyhem/SharpSCCM)'s `local secrets -m disk` command, which extends this technique to retrieve collection variables and task sequences that may also contain secrets such as credentials.

## Impact
This technique may allow an attacker to retrieve plaintext domain credentials. Even if the NAA or credential stored in a collection variable or task sequence is not overprivileged, domain credentials may be useful for attackers where explicit credentials are required, such as proxying tooling into an environment over command and control (C2). If the credential is overprivileged, this technique may enable lateral movement to other clients and/or sensitive systems.

At SpecterOps, we commonly see accounts that are members of the SCCM `Full Administrator` role and the `Domain Admins` group configured as NAAs.

Currently-configured and/or legacy NAA, collection variable, and task sequence configurations may be present in the CIM repository file. If so, an attacker can recover legacy accounts that have been configured in the past. For example, if a system administrator configured their SCCM admin account as the NAA when the site was created, but years later fixed their mistake and no longer use an overprivileged NAA or NAA at all, their SCCM admin credentials may still be on disk on SCCM clients.

### Manual

- Retrieve SYSTEM masterkey with SharpDPAPI's `machinetriage` module
- Enumerate encrypted secrets using SharpDPAPI's `search` module
- If present, manually extract the blob
- Manually parse with PowerShell:

```
