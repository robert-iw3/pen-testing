# CRED-6

## Description
Loot domain credentials, SSH keys, and more from SCCM Distribution Points (DP)

## MITRE ATT&CK TTPs
- [TA0006 - Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006)
- [T1078.002 - Valid Accounts: Domain Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/002/)

## Requirements
One of the following:
- Network access to SCCM SMB service (445/TCP) on a DP
- Network access to SCCM HTTP service (80/TCP or 443/TCP) on a DP

AND Credentials are likely to be required **but not always**

## Summary
A distribution point (DPs) is a server role used by SCCM to host the various files used in software installs, patches, script deployments, etc. By default, these servers allow access via SMB (TCP/445) and HTTP/S (TCP/80 and/or TCP/443) and require some type of Windows authentication (i.e. NTLM).

IT professionals and software engineers have a tendency of hardcoding credentials in scripts, configuration files, software, etc.

Therefore, we can loot the SCCM DP and extract valid credentials as authenticated (and sometimes unauthenticated) attackers.

#### SMB
The `C:\SCCMContentLib` folder is shared via SMB as the `SCCMContentLib$` SMB share and is accessible to any member of the Domain Users or Domain Computers groups. The file structure of the `C:\SCCMContentLib` folder is explained [here](https://github.com/badsectorlabs/sccm-http-looter/blob/main/DEFCON32_RTV_How-Ludu-%20made-it-rain-creds-from-SCCM.pdf)

#### HTTP
The IIS web server hosted on the distribution point defines a virtual directory, `SMS_DP_SMSPKG$`, which maps to the `C:\SCCMContentLib` folder explained above. The web server will perform all the file structure processing for us, allowing to retrieve resources belonging to a package through HTTP (that are by default domain-authenticated with Kerberos/NTLM, as all interactions to fetch external resources from the distribution point).

URL format to list the subdirectories and files in a package: `http://<DP>/sms_dp_smspkg$/<PackageID>/`

Retrieving a file in a package: `http://<DP>/sms_dp_smspkg$/<PackageID>/<filename>`

## Impact
If anonymous authentication (no credentials required) is enabled, an attacker can dump the DP files and analyze its contents for valid credentials. NTLM relaying is still possible under proper conditions.

If authentication is required: An internal attacker can use existing credentials to authenticate to the SMB/HTTP services to loot the Distribution Points.

#### HTTP DP Looting (NTLMRelayx to HTTP endpoint)
Currently, you can use the following version of [impacket](https://github.com/ar0dd/impacket). There is a pending [Pull Request](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/pull/1790) (as of 14 August, 2024) to include this into the main `impacket` repository.

Just run your server and wait for authentication to take place.

```bash
└─# python3 examples/ntlmrelayx.py -t http://10.2.10.12/SMS_DP_SMSPKG$/Datalib --sccm --sccm-dp-dump -smb2support
