# RECON-3

## Description
Enumerate SCCM roles via HTTP

## MITRE ATT&CK TTPs
- [TA0007](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007/) - Discovery

## Requirements
- Valid Active Directory domain credentials

## Summary
When certain site system roles are installed, part of the installation process involves configuring web services on the host system. Depending on the role, static and predictable URLs can be enumerated, and when a request is sent to the URL, it provides an expected response. Fuzzing these URLS on potential site systems contributes to attack path discovery. 

## Impact
1. Profiling site system roles is a supplementary step in building potential attack paths
2. A resolved MP role can be a target for spoofing client enrollment [CRED-2](../../CRED/CRED-2/cred-2_description.md)
3. A resolved SMS Provider role can be a target for hierarchy takeover ([TAKEOVER-5](../../TAKEOVER/TAKEOVER-5/takeover-5_description.md) and [TAKEOVER-6](../../TAKEOVER/TAKEOVER-6/takeover-6_description.md)).

## Examples
The following examples are a sampling and are not an exhaustive representation.

### Management Points
Management points (MP) host several web applications for multiple functions, including client communication, policy distribution, and health monitoring. Site systems configured with this role have predictable URL paths that require authenticaiton when interacting.  

```
C:\Users\administrator.LAB>%systemroot%\system32\inetsrv\AppCmd.exe list app
APP "Default Web Site/" (applicationPool:DefaultAppPool)
APP "Default Web Site/CCM_CLIENT" (applicationPool:CCM Client Deployment Pool)
APP "Default Web Site/CCM_Incoming" (applicationPool:CCM Server Framework Pool)
APP "Default Web Site/CCM_System" (applicationPool:CCM Server Framework Pool)
APP "Default Web Site/CCM_System_WindowsAuth" (applicationPool:CCM Windows Auth Server Framework Pool)
APP "Default Web Site/CCM_System_TokenAuth" (applicationPool:CCM Server Framework Pool)
APP "Default Web Site/CCM_STS" (applicationPool:CCM Security Token Service Pool)
APP "Default Web Site/CMUserService" (applicationPool:CCM User Service Pool)
APP "Default Web Site/CMUserService_WindowsAuth" (applicationPool:CCM Windows Auth User Service Pool)
APP "Default Web Site/SMS_MP" (applicationPool:SMS Management Point Pool)
APP "Default Web Site/SMS_MP_WindowsAuth" (applicationPool:SMS Windows Auth Management Point Pool)
APP "Default Web Site/SMS_MP_TokenAuth" (applicationPool:SMS Management Point Pool)
APP "Default Web Site/BGB" (applicationPool:CCM Client Notification Proxy Pool)
```

### SMS Provider
 The SMS Provider role hosts a collection of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) classes that translate queries to access data stored in the siteâ€™s database. In addition to WMI, the SMS Provider also hosts the Administration Service (AdminService) API, which has two static routes that require authentication:

 ```
https://<SMSProvier.FQDN>/AdminService/wmi/
https://<SMSProvier.FQDN>/AdminService/v1.0/
 ```
