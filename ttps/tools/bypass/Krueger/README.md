# Description
Krueger is a Proof of Concept (PoC) .NET post-exploitation tool for remotely killing Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) as apart of lateral movement procedures. Krueger accomplishes this task by utilizing Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC), which is a built in Microsoft created application control utility that has the ability to block code at the user and kernel-mode levels. Using Krueger with administrative permissions over a target remote device, an adversary can quickly place a WDAC policy to disk and perform a remote reboot, preventing the EDR service from starting on boot. 

Krueger can also be run from memory using tools such as `execute-assembly` and `inlineExecute-Assembly` ([@anthemtotheego](https://x.com/anthemtotheego)) . Additionally, to prevent the need to load a WDAC policy from disk while executing Krueger from memory, Krueger includes an embedded WDAC policy inside of the .NET assembly inserted at compile time which can be read from memory and written to a target at runtime.
