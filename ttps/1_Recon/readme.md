## Cyber Recce

Prepare the battlefield, before you go to war.

Cyber reconnaissance is the initial phase of a cyberattack where attackers gather information about a target system or network to identify vulnerabilities and plan attacks. It involves collecting data on network architecture, security measures, and potential entry points. This phase is crucial for attackers to tailor their attack strategies and increase their chances of success. 

##

Objectives of Cyber Reconnaissance:

    Identify Vulnerabilities:

    Attackers use reconnaissance to find weaknesses in a target's security posture. 

    Plan Attacks:

    The collected information helps attackers choose the most effective attack vectors and methods. 

    Map the Target:

    Reconnaissance provides a comprehensive understanding of the target's network, infrastructure, and systems. 

    Gather Intelligence:

    Attackers collect data on personnel, security measures, and other relevant information to build a detailed profile of the target. 

Methods Used in Cyber Reconnaissance:

    Footprinting:

    Gathering publicly available information about the target, such as company websites, social media, and open-source intelligence (OSINT). 

    Scanning:

    Using tools to identify open ports, network services, and system configurations. 

    Enumeration:

    Collecting detailed information about target systems, such as usernames, groups, and shared resources. 

    Social Engineering:

    Manipulating individuals to obtain sensitive information. 

Types of Cyber Reconnaissance: 

    Passive Reconnaissance: Gathering information without directly interacting with the target system.
    Active Reconnaissance: Engaging with the target system to gather more detailed information, such as scanning for open ports. 

Importance of Cyber Reconnaissance:

    For Attackers: It's a crucial step in planning and executing successful cyberattacks.
    For Defenders: Understanding reconnaissance helps organizations identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them. 

In essence, cyber reconnaissance is the initial phase of a cyberattack, where attackers gather information to identify vulnerabilities and plan their attack strategies. It's a critical aspect of both offensive and defensive cybersecurity practices.
