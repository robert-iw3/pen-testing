# Burp-Suite-Pro-Scan-Profiles
Custom scan profiles for use with Burp Suite Pro.

To import, select "Burp" in the top left taskbar and select "Configuration library". In the popup, select "Import" and import the json files from this repository. 

Note: It seems that when Burp updates and adds new scanner checks to the scanner configuration menu, these new checks are automatically included in already configured scan profiles. Be aware when scanning after updates that any scan profiles do not have scanner checks that are not expected.
