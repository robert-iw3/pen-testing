# SockTail (Plain Version)

This is the **plain variant** of **SockTail**, a minimal agent that joins a Tailscale network and exposes a local SOCKS5 proxy on port `1080`. Unlike the main version, this build does **not include XOR obfuscation for the Tailscale AuthKey**â€”useful for clarit or simpler runtime deployment.
