# containerized setup - right now configured to run all containers on same host and exposed through the container IP.
# if you want to expose to localhost, uncomment the ports. this will allow you to serve the frontend on localhost:443 and the backend on localhost:3000
# useful if you want to run evilginx uncontainerized on a VM, but still want access to the application. 
# could be modified for macvlan as well with some slight tweaks to the app sourcode and dockerfiles.
