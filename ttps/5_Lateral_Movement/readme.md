## Lateral Movement

Lateral movement in cybersecurity refers to the phase of an attack where a malicious actor, after gaining initial access to a network, moves laterally across systems and devices to expand their control and access to sensitive data. This phase involves techniques like reconnaissance, credential gathering, and privilege escalation to move beyond the initial entry point.

Key aspects of lateral movement:

    Moving beyond initial access:
    After gaining initial access, attackers use various techniques to move from one system to another within the network.

Techniques used:

    These include reconnaissance, credential harvesting, and privilege escalation.

Examples of tools and techniques:

    Attackers may use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), PowerShell, or Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to move across systems and install malware.

Goal:

    The objective of lateral movement is to expand control within the network, access valuable data, and potentially maintain persistent access.

Indicators of lateral movement:

    Multiple login attempts across systems, unusual network activity, and anomalous connectivity patterns can be signs of lateral movement.
