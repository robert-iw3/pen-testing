# NetExec - The Network Execution Tool

This project was initially created in 2015 by @byt3bl33d3r, known as CrackMapExec. In 2019 @mpgn_x64 started maintaining the project for the next 4 years, adding a lot of great tools and features. In September 2023 he retired from maintaining the project.

Along with many other contributors, we (NeffIsBack, Marshall-Hallenbeck, and zblurx) developed new features, bug fixes, and helped maintain the original project CrackMapExec.
During this time, with both a private and public repository, community contributions were not easily merged into the project. The 6-8 month discrepancy between the code bases caused many development issues and heavily reduced community-driven development.
With the end of mpgn's maintainer role, we (the remaining most active contributors) decided to maintain the project together as a fully free and open source project under the new name **NetExec** ðŸš€
Going forward, our intent is to maintain a community-driven and maintained project with regular updates for everyone to use.
