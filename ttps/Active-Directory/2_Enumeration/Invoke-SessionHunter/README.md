# Invoke-SessionHunter
Retrieve and display information about active user sessions on remote computers. No admin privileges required.

The tool leverages the remote registry service to query the HKEY_USERS registry hive on the remote computers. It identifies and extracts Security Identifiers (SIDs) associated with active user sessions, and translates these into corresponding usernames, offering insights into who is currently logged in.

If the `-CheckAdminAccess` switch is provided, it will gather sessions by authenticating to targets where you have local admin access using [Invoke-WMIRemoting](https://github.com/Leo4j/Invoke-WMIRemoting) (which most likely will retrieve more results)

It's important to note that the remote registry service needs to be running on the remote computer for the tool to work effectively. In my tests, if the service is stopped but its Startup type is configured to "Automatic" or "Manual", the service will start automatically on the target computer once queried (this is native behavior), and sessions information will be retrieved. If set to "Disabled" no session information can be retrieved from the target.

### Usage:

Load Invoke-SessionHunter in memory

```
iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Leo4j/Invoke-SessionHunter/main/Invoke-SessionHunter.ps1')
```

If run without parameters or switches it will retrieve active sessions for all computers in the current domain by querying their remote registry

```
Invoke-SessionHunter
```

Gather sessions by authenticating to targets where you have local admin access ('klist sessions' command is run on targets)

```
Invoke-SessionHunter -CheckAsAdmin
```

You can optionally provide credentials in the following format

```
Invoke-SessionHunter -CheckAsAdmin -UserName "ferrari\Administrator" -Password "P@ssw0rd!"
```

Invoke-SessionHunter is designed to keep your host machine, your current user, and the provided username out of scope. 

As a result, they won't show among the retrieved sessions.

If you want to include them within the retrieved results please provide the -ShowAll and/or -IncludeLocalHost switches.

```
Invoke-SessionHunter -ShowAll -IncludeLocalHost
```

Invoke-SessionHunter will skip any target where the remote registry fails to respond within 2000ms (2 seconds).

You have control on the timeout by providing the -Timeout parameter | Default = 2000, increase for slower networks.

```
Invoke-SessionHunter -Timeout 5000
```

Use the -Match switch to show only targets where you have admin access and a privileged user is logged in

```
Invoke-SessionHunter -Match
```

All switches can be combined

```
Invoke-SessionHunter -CheckAsAdmin -UserName "ferrari\Administrator" -Password "P@ssw0rd!" -Timeout 5000 -Match
```

### Specify the target domain

```
Invoke-SessionHunter -Domain contoso.local
```

### Specify a comma-separated list of targets or the full path to a file containing a list of targets - one per line

```
Invoke-SessionHunter -Targets "DC01,Workstation01.contoso.local"
```
```
Invoke-SessionHunter -Targets c:\Users\Public\Documents\targets.txt
```

### Retrieve and display information about active user sessions on servers only

```
Invoke-SessionHunter -Servers
```

### Retrieve and display information about active user sessions on workstations only

```
Invoke-SessionHunter -Workstations
```
	
### Show active session for the specified user only

```
Invoke-SessionHunter -Hunt "Administrator"
```

### Return custom PSObjects instead of table-formatted results

```
Invoke-SessionHunter -RawResults
```

### Do not run a port scan to enumerate for alive hosts before trying to retrieve sessions

Note: if a host is not reachable it may hang for a while

```
Invoke-SessionHunter -NoPortScan
```
