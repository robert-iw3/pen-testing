# VarPrintLib & VarPrintReader
In some systems, `Print(L"");` cannot be used, even if you try connecting all the controller handles.
This library allows the printing of debug messages or statuses to the `VarPrint*` UEFI variables, allowing the variable content to be obtained and checked later.


## Features

#### VarPrintLib
- `VarPrint("hoge %d", someint)`: Writes debug msg (ascii format string) to `VarPrintVar` variable
    - Latest 8 `char[0x40]` msgs are stored
- `VarLogStatus(0xAA)`: Writes single byte to `VarLogStatus` variable
    - Latest 32 status are stored
- `VarPrintLargeBin(PtrToLargeData)`: Writes large binary data (up to 0x400 byte) to `VarLargeVar` variable
    - Only 1 data point is stored
- `VarErase()`: Clear all messages and status

#### VarPrintReader
- UEFI app (execute via the UEFI shell) to print var-printed messages/status/binaries.


## Installation
1. Setup EDK2
1. Copy VarPrintPkg to `edk2/`
1. Setup `edk2/Conf/target.txt`
    1. `ACTIVE_PLATFORM = VarPrintPkg/VarPrintPkg.dsc`
    1. `TARGET_ARCH = X64`
    1. `TOOL_CHAIN_TAG = GCC5`
1. `source edksetup.sh` & `build`

Then, set up similar to the other EDK2 libraries, `#include <Library/VarPrintLib.h>`, and use the library functions listed in "Features".
In addition, VarPrintReader.efi is created (which can be executed via the UEFI shell).
