# CVE-2024-27316

I decided to call this vulnerability specifically "CVE-2024-27316" since I have tested it against this vulnerability. The underlying flaw effects other CVEs so I thought I'd mention those with the hope that others could test and modify this PoC :)

This PoC currently only works against unencrypted http/2 servers.
