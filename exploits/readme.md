Take advantage of identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to systems, applications, or networks. It's a crucial stage where the focus shifts from simply discovering weaknesses to demonstrating the real-world risk they pose.

##

The exploitation phase builds upon the results of previous phases, such as reconnaissance, scanning, and vulnerability assessment. Testers use the knowledge gained to:

### Develop and use exploits:

This involves creating or customizing tools and payloads specifically designed to target the identified vulnerabilities.

### Launch targeted attacks:

Testers simulate real-world attacks to test how easily an attacker could gain access using those vulnerabilities.

### Gain unauthorized access:

If successful, the testers document how they accessed the system and determine the scope of their access (e.g., can they escalate privileges, move laterally through the network?).

### Assess the impact:

They evaluate how much access they have gained, how easy it is to maintain access, and the potential harm the exploited vulnerability could cause.

### Examples of vulnerabilities exploited:

    Weak passwords:

    Testers might try to crack weak passwords or guess them using available information.

    Unpatched systems:

    Exploiting vulnerabilities in outdated software or systems where security patches haven't been applied.

    Configuration errors:

    Taking advantage of misconfigurations in software or network settings.

    Injection vulnerabilities:

    Exploiting weaknesses in web applications or other systems where user-provided data isn't properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious code.
