### Mitigations
    - Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 version 1809 are not vulnerable by default. Unless you have enabled the HTTP Trailer Support via EnableTrailerSupport registry value, the systems are not vulnerable.
    - Delete the DWORD registry value "EnableTrailerSupport" if present under:
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\HTTP\Parameters
    - This mitigation only applies to Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10, version 1809 and does not apply to the Windows 20H2 and newer.
