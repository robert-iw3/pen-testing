* The flaw allows attackers to inject external DTDs (Document Type Definitions) and exploit XML parsers to leak local file content.
* Techniques such as error-based parsing and out-of-band (OOB) data exfiltration can be used.

---

## üìä Severity:

* **CVSS v3.1 Score**: 5.8 (Medium üü†)
* **Attack Vector**: Network
* **Privileges Required**: None
* **User Interaction**: None
* **Impact**: Confidentiality breach (e.g., reading `/etc/passwd`)

---

## ‚úÖ Mitigation Steps:

1. **Update to CloudTest version 60 or later**, where external entity parsing is disabled by default.
2. **Disable DTD processing** in XML parsers manually if an upgrade isn't possible.
3. **Restrict network access** to CloudTest instances (e.g., via firewalls and IP allowlists).
4. **Monitor XML traffic** for anomalies or known exploit patterns.
5. **Limit file access permissions** for the CloudTest service to reduce impact.
6. **Deploy a WAF (Web Application Firewall)** with rules against XXE attacks.

## üìÖ Timeline:

* Vulnerability discovered: June 2025
* Fix released: Early July 2025
* Proof of Concept (PoC) exists publicly.
* No confirmed mass exploitation as of now.
