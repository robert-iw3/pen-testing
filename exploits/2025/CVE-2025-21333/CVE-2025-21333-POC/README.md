# CVE-2025-21333-POC

Proof of Concept that exploits [CVE-2025-21333](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-21333) in vkrnlintvsp.sys (not so reliable see Requirements and Limitations section). Under the References section are located very helpful resources for who wants to play with the exploit.

A detailed analysis of the vulnerability and the exploit is available [here](https://medium.com/@ale18109800/cve-2025-21333-windows-heap-based-buffer-overflow-analysis-d1b597ae4bae).

The vulnerability was detected as actively exploited by threat actors.

Tested on **Windows 11 23h2**.

It may work also on **Windows 11 24h2** but I didn't test it.

Below the hash of the ntoskrnl.exe and vkrnlintvsp.sys that were used to test the POC.

## Overwriting I/O Ring buffer entry to get arbitrary read/write

It doesn't use NtQuerySystemInformation to leak kernel addresses nor PreviousMode to get arbitrary read/write.

Instead, It allocates in the Paged Pool an array of pointers to [_IOP_MC_BUFFER_ENTRY](https://www.vergiliusproject.com/kernels/x64/windows-11/23h2/_IOP_MC_BUFFER_ENTRY) and overwrites the first pointer with a malicious IOP_MC_BUFFER_ENTRY* located in user-space. Using _BuildIoRingWriteFile()_/_BuildIoRingReadFile()_ It is possible to obtain arbitrary read/write in the kernel.

The array of pointers to __IOP_MC_BUFFER_ENTRY_ is an object with PoolTag **IrRB**.

The technique slightly differs from the one documented by Yarden Shafir [here](https://windows-internals.com/one-i-o-ring-to-rule-them-all-a-full-read-write-exploit-primitive-on-windows-11/). Instead of taking control of the entire array pointed by _IORING_OBJECT.RegBuffers, the technique takes control **only of one entry** in the array pointed by _IORING_OBJECT.RegBuffers.

Since the size of the array of pointers is controllable by the user, this means It can be used to obtain reliable arbitrary read/write in ring0 starting from heap-overflows and UAFs for multiple LFH buckets.

I don't know if someone already shared this technique to exploit overflows or UAFs in the paged pool.

These screenshot were taken after executing the poc. The overflow was in the bucket for object size 0x50. Notice It was possible to allocate a RegBuffers array in that bucket and the first pointer points to user-space memory.

Notice the malicious entry sets the _Address_ to a process object. _Address_ corresponds to the arbitrary address that we may want to read from/write to (this already well described by Yarden Shafir's article).

## Requirements and Limitations

It is necessary to turn on the **windows sandbox feature** so that the vulnerable syscalls are handled by the vulnerable driver.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7becbeab-446d-4f65-9761-fdd51eea4f61)

I managed to get an **overflow of 0xfff0 bytes**. I didn't manage to make the overflow length fully controllable. You can see a **crash if the overflow is bigger than the subsegment** (It may happen quite often). Maybe by spraying more objects It is possible to minimize this behavior.

The poc frees 2 WNF state data to reallocate in that positions a regBuffer (an array of pointers to [_IOP_MC_BUFFER_ENTRY](https://www.vergiliusproject.com/kernels/x64/windows-11/23h2/_IOP_MC_BUFFER_ENTRY)associated to an IORING_OBJECT) and a PipeAttribute. Sometimes, between the free and the realloc, It may happen that another object is allocated in that position by another driver. It would be possible to use other corrupted WNF state data objects in a while loop to perform multiple reallocation attempts and increase the possibility to have the desired layout.

The poc code is quite messy.

After getting system It is better to **exit from the system shell typing `exit` in the console** otherwise the **machine will crash**.

## Compile and Run

Compile x64 Release version.

Run and get a system shell.
