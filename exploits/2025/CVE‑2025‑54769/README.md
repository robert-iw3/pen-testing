# CVE-2025-54769 – LPAR2RRD (RCE)

## Description : 
 

This repository contains a Proof‑of‑Concept (PoC) exploit for CVE-2025-54769, a vulnerability found in lpar2rrd.


The vulnerability allows remote code execution (RCE) and directory traversal by abusing the /lpar2rrd-cgi/upgrade.sh endpoint. The exploit workflow is as follows:


- Script Generation : 


Automatically creates a malicious Perl CGI payload (users.pl) that executes arbitrary shell commands (default: whoami).


- Payload Upload :


Uses libcurl to POST the generated script as an “upgrade package” to the vulnerable endpoint, bypassing basic file validation.


- Directory Traversal : 


Exploits a path traversal flaw to move the uploaded script into the CGI directory, making it accessible for execution.


- Command Execution & Retrieval:


Triggers the CGI script via a crafted GET request (/lpar2rrd-cgi/users.sh?cmd=commandLinux) and captures the command output for the attacker.


## Usage :

```
gcc exploit.c argparse.c -o exploit -lcurl
./exploit -i <IP> -p PORT -t <PROTOCOL>
```
- Verbose Mode :
```
./exploit -i <IP> -p <PORT> -t <PROTOCOL> -v 
``` 

Replace with the target LPAR2RRD instance. The target port should match the service (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS), and the protocol should be either http or https
