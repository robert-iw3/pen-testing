# ðŸ“† Changelog

## [25. February 2025] - Version 0.13.0

- **Google Gemini, xAI Grok & DeepSeek Integration**  
  Added support for multiple AI providers in risk assessment. Users can now choose between OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Grok AI or DeepSeek via the new `--ai` option.

- **Local CVE Database Update & Cloning**  
  Implemented update (`--local`) functionality for the CVE List V5 repository. SploitScan now clones (or pulls updates from) the full CVE List V5 repository locally. 

- **Keyword-Based CVE Search Across Sources**  
  Enhanced the search functionality to allow users to search for keywords via `--keywords` (e.g., "Apple") across both the local CVE database and remote sources (CISA and Nuclei Templates). All matching CVEs are automatically looked up by SploitScan to search for associated exploits.

- **Fast Mode for Streamlined Output**  
  Introduced a fast mode (`--fast-mode`) that limits the output to only basic CVE information, bypassing additional lookups (such as public exploits, EPSS, and risk assessments) for quicker results.

## [26. January 2025] - Version 0.12.0

- **CVSS Parsing Enhancements**  
  Updated the `extract_cvss_info()` function to handle a broader range of CVSS fields: checks for CVSSv4.0, v3.1, v3.0, and v3 in that order, and then falls back to ADP entries if necessary.

- **Date Parsing Unification**  
  Introduced a new `parse_iso_date()` helper. Replaced direct `datetime.fromisoformat()` calls throughout the code with this function for consistent date formatting, including error handling for trailing Z characters.

- **VulnCheck Key Handling**  
  Improved error handling for the VulnCheck API key checkâ€”now returns a clearer error message if no VulnCheck key is configured.

- **HTML Report Template Overhaul**  
  Updated and reformatted the HTML export template for improved readability and consistency. Enhanced the layout for displaying references, exploit details, and the AI-powered risk assessment. Moved to a more standardized code style.

- **Refined Public Exploits Display**  
  Enhanced how exploit PoCs are sorted and displayed.

- **Dependency Upgrades**  
  Updated `requests` (2.32.2 â†’ 2.32.3), `jinja2` (3.1.4 â†’ 3.1.5), and `openai` (1.30.2 â†’ 1.60.1) in `requirements.txt`.


- **General Code Cleanup**  
  - Organized imports and method parameters for clarity (e.g., specifying `params=` in all relevant requests).  
  - Tweaked debug output for loading the configuration file, making it more verbose and consistent.  
  - Adjusted logic for selecting public exploits to be clearer and more maintainable.

## [05. September 2024] - Version 0.11.0

- **Method Selection Added**: Introduced a new `-m` argument to allow users to selectively run specific methods (e.g., `cisa`, `epss`, `hackerone`, `ai`, `prio`, `references`). This enables more granular control over which data sources and assessments are retrieved for each CVE.
- **Import List Auto-Detection**: Added functionality to automatically detect and handle plain text CVE lists when using the `-i` option without specifying an import type (`-t`). If the file is detected as a plain text CVE list, it will import the CVE IDs directly without requiring a specific type.
- **CSV Export Fix**: Fixed an issue where CISA data was not properly exported to CSV. Now, all relevant CISA information is included in the exported CSV file.
- **HTML Export Fix**: Resolved an issue where `NoneType` errors caused the HTML export to fail. Improved error handling to ensure that missing or empty data does not interrupt the export process.

## [13. August 2024] - Version 0.10.5
